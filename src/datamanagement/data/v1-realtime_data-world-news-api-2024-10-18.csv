This is to enable them to boost their business capital and be financially literate and key into the state’s financial inclusion system.

The Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Sustainable Development Goals, Dr Oreoluwa Finnih-Awokoya, disclosed this at a press conference in Lagos, on Thursday.

She said it was part of the responsibility of her office to promote human capital development through advocacy programmes, especially in areas where they lack assistance.

Finnih-Awokoya, flanked in her office in Ikeja by the representatives of the financial institutions partnering with the government, said it was the overall mandate of her office to eliminate financial exclusion.

She said to benefit from the programme, the women traders must have National Identification Numbers, and the Lagos State Resident Registration Agency ID.

“Collaboration is evidently the major approach to a private partnership, and this is why the SDG approached these relevant institutions. Nevertheless, we extend an invitation to all institutions to join us in this meritorious human capital development generally.

“Human capital development matters reflect the strength and growth of the society, but it was meant to implement the growth of the society. 

“It is going to be two sums, these two sums are a success factor for sustainable development growth. We can accomplish an equitable Lagos where every human thrives irrespective of their circumstances.”

The representative of OPAY financial institution, Adedotun Adekunle, said the essence of the programme was to get a lot of people into the financial ecosystem.

He said it was the nexus of what they were doing as a corporate financial organisation to get as many men and women into the financial ecosystem, to get them educated and empower them to do business so they can earn a living.

The representative of Cowry Wise, another financial institution, Oyeyinka Oyekan, said the core objective of Cowrie Wise since its establishment in 2017 was to make savings and investment accessible to all Africans, regardless of their socioeconomic background.

He said, “We are eager to partner with the office of the Sustainable Development Goals to inculcate financial integrity into indigent saturated areas of Lagos State through the human capital development initiative, we believe that financial integrity is not a privilege but a fundamental human right.

“Furthermore, financial literacy is the sustainable part of sustainable development growth, even more significant, this partnership which makes each initiative ignorant significant, this partnership will enable us to extend financial institutions to those who need it most, because of their financial future, and by extension contribute to our great state Lagos.”

He noted that by fostering financial literacy, they aimed to reduce barriers to economic participation and enable long-term participation for individuals and their families, particularly in underserved communities."

Segun James in Lagos and Michael Olugbode in Abuja

To upscale the lot of the women folks in Lagos State, the state government has gone into partnership with some financial institutions to make loans easily available to indigent women and traders.

The move is to enable them boost their business capital and be financially literate in order to key into the state’s financial inclusion system.

In another related development, UN Women and the Organisation of African Instituted Churches (OIAC) have called for Christian leaders to escalate action to curb violence against women and girls.

This appeal came during a two-day UN Women and Ford Foundation-supported workshop for members of the OAIC.

On Lagos State’s partnership with some financial institutions, the Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Sustainable Development Goals, Dr. Oreoluwa Finnih- Awokoya, who disclosed this yesterday, said it is part of the responsibility of her office to promote human capital development through advocacy programmes put together by her office and promote development in areas where they lack assistance.

She explained that to benefit from the programme the women trader must have National Identification Number NIN, Lagos State Resident Registration Agency (LASRRA).

Her words: “Collaboration is evidently the major approach to private partnership, and this is why the SDG approached these relevant institutions. Nevertheless, we extend an invitation to all institutions to join us in this meritorious human capital development generally.

“Human capital development matters reflect the strength and growth of the society, but it was meant to implement the growth of the society. It is going to be two sums. These two sums are a success factor for the sustainable development growth. We can accomplish an equitable Lagos where every human thrives irrespective of their circumstances.”

Finnih- Awokoya who was flanked by representatives of the financial institutions partnering the government said it is the overall mandate of her office to eliminate financial exclusion which most women had been subjected to.

In his remark the representative of OPAY financial institution, Mr. Adedotun Adekunle, said the essence of the programme is to get a lot of people into the financial ecosystem.

He said it is the nexus of what they are doing as a corporate financial organisation to get as many men and women into the financial ecosystem, to get them educated and empower them to do business and so they can earn a living.

The representative of Cowry Wise, another financial institution, Mr. Oyeyinka Oyekan, said core objectives of Cowrie Wise since its establishment in 2017 was to make savings and investment accessible to all Africans, regardless of their social economic background.

He said: “We are eager to partner the office of the Sustainable Development Goal SDGs, to inculcate financial integrity into indigent saturated areas of Lagos State through the human capital development initiative. We believe that financial integrity is not a privilege but a fundamental human right.

“Furthermore, financial literacy is the sustainable part of the sustainable development growth. This partnership will enable us to extend financial institutions to those who need it most because of their financial future, and by extension contribute to our great state Lagos.”

He noted that by fostering financial literacy, they aimed to reduce barriers in economic participation and enable long term participation for individuals and their families, particularly underserved communities, because they need to take control of their financial future and by extension introduce their financial institution.

Meanwhile, UN Women and OAIC (a community of leaders of different churches) explained the workshop targets enhancement of the knowledge of Christian leaders on the nuances of gender-based violence, initiate collective action against gender-based violence through the various church mechanisms, and provide the opportunity for Christian leaders and churches to network and consolidate on the fight against gender-based violence.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one in three women worldwide has experienced physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) reports that an estimated 137 women are killed daily by a partner or family member globally, highlighting the severe consequences of GBV.

In Nigeria, GBV remains a significant challenge, manifesting in various forms, such as domestic violence, sexual assault, and harmful traditional practices. These issues are often perpetuated by cultural norms and religious misinterpretations that justify violence and discrimination against women and girls.

Religious leaders, as moral guides and influencers within their communities, play a critical role in either reinforcing these harmful norms or championing efforts to eradicate GBV. This informed the reason behind organizing the workshop to lobby them.

According to a statement by UN Women on Thursday, the workshop is intended to impact sermons delivered by clergies and Christian leaders so that messages delivered over the pulpit have interpretations of religious texts and tenets that address gender inequality, condemn gender-based violence and harmful traditional practices, and promote gender justice.

UN Women Programmes Officer Ibrahim Nurudeen facilitated sessions that demystified some harmful social norms and beliefs common in the religious cycle.

Participants affirmed that some tenets need to be appropriately communicated in the contemporary context.

According to the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev. Daniel Okoh, “We must use this opportunity to deal with deprivation of opportunities for the female members to exercise their God-given talents by their spouses and the leadership of their churches.

“We must first deal with these issues connected to GBV before we can effectively give moral leadership in this advocacy and, indeed, the battle”.

The workshop provided in-depth analysis of GBV’s socio-economic impact, its implications, and the critical role of religious leaders in combating this issue.

Participants were equipped with strategies to incorporate gender equality principles in their messages, marriage counselling, and promoting healthy and respectful relationships.

President, OIAC Nigeria, Israel Akinadewo said: “Conclusively, as a noble organisation as ours, I would appeal that after these sessions, we become champions of spiritual battalions combating any form of GBV.”

The statement said by empowering religious leaders with the knowledge and tools they need, UN Women aims to drive a transformative socio-cultural shift towards a more just, equitable, and violence-free society in Nigeria and across West Africa."

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC),has scheduled the Anambra State governorship election for Saturday November 8, 2025.

INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, disclosed this yesterday in Abuja at the fourth regular consultative meeting with political parties.

He explained that Section 28(1) of the Electoral Act 2022 required the commission to issue the notice for elections not later than 360 days before the date of the election, saying this applied to the general as well as off-cycle governorship elections.

Yakubu stated: “As you are aware, the last governorship election in Anambra State was held on 6th November 2021. By the effluxion of time, the governorship election is due next year.

“Consequently, the Commission has approved that the 2025 Anambra State governorship election will hold on Saturday 8th November 2025.

“In compliance with the mandatory requirement of 360 days, the formal notice for the election will be published on 13th November 2024. Party primaries will be held from 20th March 2025 to 10th April 2025.

“The candidate nomination portal will open at 9.00am on 18th April 2025 and close at 6.00pm on 12th May 2025. The final list of candidates will be published on 9th June 2025.

“Campaigns in public by political parties will commence on 11th June 2025 and end at midnight of Thursday 6th November 2025.

“Voting will take place in all the 5,720 Polling Units across the State on Saturday 8th November 2025.

“In the coming weeks, the Commission will provide details of other electoral activities, including the registration of new voters, transfer of voters and the replacement of lost or damaged PVCs.”

The chairman noted that the detailed timetable and schedule of activities for the 2025 Anambra State election would be uploaded on its website and social media platforms.

Yakubu, therefore, urged political parties to use the INEC timetable to come up with their own timetable and schedule of activities to enable them work together and plan better for the deployment of personnel and resources for the monitoring of party primaries and campaign activities.

He said by doing so, they would avoid the last minute rush with the attendant inability to meet deadlines.

Chairman of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Yusuf Dantalle, reiterated its demand for the scrapping of the State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs), saying the sham called elections they conduct were deliberate assault on the nation’s democracy.

He said the council would not fold its hand and allow this glaring perversion of the democratic process to continue."

“It is not just a coronation of the candidates of a ruling party in the state, it is daylight robbery of people’s votes and mandates for chairmanship and councilor positions.

“Today, we are holding the last in our regular quarterly consultative meetings with political parties for this year. We are glad that you continue to oblige us with your presence, despite the short notice.

Senators at plenary, yesterday, passed a vote of confidence in the leadership of the Senate led by its President, Godswill Akpabio.

At the same time, the Deputy Spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Hon Philip Agbese, has pledged the readiness of his colleagues to continue to support the Speaker, Tajudeen Abbas, in his quest of leading the 10th House to deliver on its Legislative Agenda.

The Senate resolution followed a motion by a former Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, who raised a point of order to draw the attention of his colleagues to a news report, which indicated that northern senators were plotting to impeach Akpabio.

Abdullahi, who is representing Kebbi North Senatorial District, denied his involvement, or that of any member of the Northern Senators Forum in the alleged plot.

He said, “I am senior member of the Northern Senators’ Forum and I can assure you that there is no attempt by any caucus among the northern senators to bring discord or any attempt to challenge the unity of what you are doing in the Senate.

“My privilege has been breached. Anybody trying to bring division across any regional line is undermining the progress of our democracy and undermining the capacity of this institution to deliver to deliver in the presence of governors of this country.

“Therefore, we must rise and get united under the leadership to ensure that this kind of discourse is completely negated, so that the kind of unity that we have forged in the last 18 months can be sustained and fully accomplished.”

Agbese, who lauded the speaker’s ‘humility’ stated that his legislative intelligence and resolve to carry members along regardless of party affiliations was responsible for the unity in the House.

The lawmaker while briefing journalists noted that though lawmakers in the House were elected on the platform of eight different political parties, the unity in the legislative chamber was non-negotiable.

“People have asked me the secret to the unity in the House but what I tell them is this: ‘The Speaker of the 10th House of Representatives is a humble leader, whose kind is very rare in this part of the world. We are fully behind him because his leadership is infectious.

ABUJA – Barely 24 hours after rumour of an alleged plot to impeach the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, caused scare at the Na-tional Assembly on Wednesday, the Senate on Thursday passed a vote of confidence in its Presi-dent, Godswill Akpabio.

This followed a point of order raised by Sen. Yahaya Abdulla-hi (PDP: Kebbi) during plenary while reacting to the alleged re-ported impeachment move on the Senate President.

Coming under personal expla-nation, Senator Abdullahi drew the attention of the upper cham-ber to the said news publication.

“It was reported that senators from the northern part of the country were plotting to impeach the leadership of the Senate led by Akpabio.

“I am a senior member of the Northern Senators’ Forum and I can assure you that there is no attempt by any caucus among the northern senators to bring dis-cord or any attempt to challenge the unity of what you are doing in the Senate.

“My privilege has been breached. Anybody trying to bring division across any regional line is undermining the progress of our democracy and undermin-ing the capacity of this institution to deliver.

“Therefore, we must rise and get united under the leadership to ensure that this kind of discourse is completely negated so that the kind of unity that we have forged in the last 18 months can be sus-tained and fully accomplished.

“I rise with you in the sense of your master-heart and I’m sure, all of my colleagues also feel the same.

“For us to be characterised as either promoting or supporting or allowing anybody to bring the leadership of this institution down.

“I have never in my life asso-ciated with anybody in order to bring or to divide any institution along ethnic or religious lines.

“I think this is the work of some enemies which should be resisted and all of us should stand united behind the Senate leader-ship to make sure that this institu-tion is preserved,” Abdullahi said.

Supporting the motion, Sen. Abdul Ningi (PDP: Bauchi) said, “I think it is important for some of us that are probably being seen as the front liners, to say, without a doubt.

“I move that we enforce our vote of confidence in both you, the President, and the entire leader-ship of the National Assembly in this regard. And I’m very positive that this is the way to go about it”.

Reacting, Akpabio said, “On behalf of my brother, the Deputy Senate President, and the entire leadership, I assure you that the bond existing between us and the Senate will continue.

“No amount of people, no so-cial media will come here to break that bond. I thank you for this and we are very humbled”.

Northern Senators Distance Selves From Impeachment Scare

Meanwhile, some northern senators on Thursday distanced themselves from the reported move to impeach the Senate Pres-ident, Godswill Akpabio.

Recall that the Senate earlier in the day passed a vote of con-fidence in the President of the Senate, and the entire leadership of the Senate.

Moving a motion for the pass-ing of vote of confidence, Senator Abdul Ningi representing (Bau-chi Central), and supported by Senator Aminu Abass (Adama-wa Central) called on all senators irrespective of party affiliations to support the vote of confidence in the President of the Senate and the entire leadership of the Senate.

A statement by Jackson Udom, Special Assistant Media to the President of the Senate, revealed that Ningi based the reason for the motion on the rumoured im-peachment of the President of the Senate, which went viral on Wednesday in the social media.

He said Ningi argued that his privilege as a senator from the North was breached by the fake news that the northern caucus was planning to change the lead-ership of the Senate.

Adding that the Bauchi lawmaker said the caucus was satisfied with the leadership of Senator Akpabio and had not contemplated any change.

According to Udom, the law-maker urged the entire Senate to rally round Senator Akpabio and the leadership of the 10th Senate.

“The Senate after the motion unanimously passed the vote of confidence in the President of the Senate and the entire leadership, pledging their total support and cooperation to the leadership of the Senate.

“President of the Senate, in his brief remarks, after the vote of confidence, thanked his col-leagues for the confidence reposed in his leadership and reassured them of the continued commit-ment of the Senate leadership to the development of the country,” the statement maintained."

The vote of confidence on Senate’s presiding and principal officers came on the heels of reports that some senators were planning to impeach Akpabio.

Some online media platforms had speculated on Wednesday that the Presidency had drafted a large number of operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) to the National Assembly Complex in Abuja to stop senators from performing their constitutional responsibilities, including a plot to remove Akpabio as the Senate President.

Akpabio had denied the report, saying the Red Chamber remained united.

Also in a statement, the Presidency said there were no impeachment threats against Akpabio.

The resolution of the Senate followed a motion by former Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi, who raised a Point of Order to draw the attention of his colleagues to a news report which indicated that northern senators were plotting to impeach Akpabio.

Abdullahi, who represents Kebbi North on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), denied his involvement or that of any other member of the Northern Senators’ Forum in the alleged plot."

The message warned that if Salman failed to pay, his fate would be worse than that of NCP leader Baba Siddiqui, who was recently murdered. However, the police later termed the message as a ‘prank’.
According to Mumbai Police, the sender claimed, “Don’t take it lightly, if Salman Khan wants to stay alive and wants to end the enmity with Lawrence Bishnoi, then he will have to pay Rs 5 crore.”
“If the money is not given, Salman Khan’s condition will be worse than Baba Siddique. An investigation has been started in this matter,” the police informed.
Death Threats To Salman Khan
The Mumbai Police have launched a probe to search for the person who sent the threatening WhatsApp message. The Bollywood star has been receiving death threats since the last few months. In fact, his security has also been increased following the killing of former Maharashtra minister and leader of NCP, Baba Siddique.
Baba Siddiqui was shot and killed on October 12 by three individuals. Four people have been arrested in connection with Siddiqui’s murder so far, while others are still absconding. The connection of Lawrence Bishnoi gang directly in the murder case of Siddiqui is under investigation.
Earlier in April this year, two men on a bike opened fire outside Salman Khan’s residence in Mumbai’s Bandra. The Mumbai Police claim that the shooters were hired by Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang, who had allegedly conspired to kill the actor.
The police further revealed that the Lawrence Bishnoi gang had planned a more extensive attack on Salman Khan and there is a threat to his life."

The extortion threat was received by the Mumbai Traffic Police, purportedly offering to resolve the ongoing face-off between the actor and the jailed Bishnoi in return for coughing out a payment of Rs five crore.

However, it also warned that if the extortion amount was not given, then Khan could meet a fate worse than businessman Baba Ziauddin Siddique, a ruling ally of Nationalist Congress Party, who was brutally shot dead in Bandra East October 12.

The ominous message on Whats App said: “If Salman Khan wants to stay alive and wants to end the enmity with Bishnoi, then he must pay up Rs five crore. Do not take this lightly, otherwise, Salman Khan’s condition will be worse than Baba Siddique.”

Taking it seriously, the Mumbai Police have started a probe into the antecedents of the sender, their intention behind the extortion-death threats, etc, considering that last month a young couple had thratened the actor’s father Salim Khan “merely for fun”, but sparked huge alarm.

For several years, Khan and his dad have been at the receiving end of the Bishnoi gang’s threats, ultimatums, extortion demands, even a bout of a warning firing at their home in Galaxy Apartments in Bandra West, and gunning down of his close pal Siddique last week.

Interestingly, after the April firing at the Khan home, the Bishnoi gang had termed it as the “final warning”, and this time the extortion threat has called upon the actor not to take it “lightly” or face consequences akin to Siddique.

After the series of threats, the Mumbai Police have beefed up security at the Khan household, his shoots at the Goregaon Film City and other studios, his office, the family’s country house, Arpita Farms in Panvel (Raigad), and the routes the actor takes to and from work, higher scrutiny and other restrictions on his visitors.

A case has been registered at Worli police station under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita for threat and extortion."

However, the Opposition parties described the move as “scaling down from the goal post of Article 370”.

The draft resolution was reportedly discussed during the first Cabinet meeting chaired by the newly-elected Chief Minister on Thursday (October 18, 2024). Mr. Abdullah and his five Ministers attended the first Cabinet at the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar.

Despite the reports of the resolution being widely reported in the media in J&K, the National Conference (NC) and the government officials are tight-lipped about the resolution or its content. When contacted, the NC leaders did not categorically deny the development.

The development, however, evoked sharp criticism from the Opposition parties. Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader and legislator Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra said Mr. Abdullah’s first resolution on Statehood “is nothing less than ratification of the August 5th, 2019 decision”.

“No resolution on Article 370 and scaling down the demand to mere statehood is a huge setback, especially after seeking votes on the promise of restoring Article 370,” Mr. Parra said.

J&K Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone questioned the “mystery and secrecy” of the development. “I hope the Chief Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir has notified it as is the protocol. And I very humbly state that the will of the people of J&K is reflected in the Assembly and not in the cabinet. The cabinet is a majoritarian institution of governance. It does not reflect all shades and opinions as per the will of the people of J&K,” Mr. Lone said.

He said the Assembly was the proper institution for addressing major issues like that of Statehood or Article 370. “When the NC government passed a resolution on autonomy they passed it in the Assembly, not through a cabinet resolution. What has changed now,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Abdullah’s government has distributed portfolios among the five Ministers, two from the Kashmir valley and three from the Jammu region. No elected Congress leader has joined Mr. Abdullah’s Cabinet so far, in spite of being an alliance partner.

Surinder Kumar Choudhary, who is J&K’s Deputy Chief Minister, has been given the portfolios of Public Works (Roads & Buildings), Industries and Commerce, Mining, Labour and Employment and Skill Development. 

NC legislator Sakeena Masood Itoo got the portfolios of Health & Medical Education, School Education, Higher Education, and Social Welfare. Javed Ahmed Rana has been given Jal Shakti, Forest, Ecology & Environment and Tribal Affairs, while Javid Ahmad Dar Agriculture Production, Rural Development & Panchayati Raj, Cooperative, and Election. 

Satish Sharma, who won as an Independent candidate from Jammu’s Chhamb constituency, was given the portfolios of Food, Civil Supplies & Consumer Affairs, Transport, Science & Technology, Information Technology, Youth Services & Sports and ARI and Trainings."

SC grants bail to late gangster-politician Mukhtar Ansari’s son in violation of model code of conduct case

The apex court on August 14 had issued notice to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and sought its reply on the appeal filed by Mr. Ansari challenging an order of the Allahabad High Court which rejected his bail. The high court on May 9 had dismissed his bail plea.

Considering the material available on record, including the flow charts which clearly demonstrate the origin of funds and also explains how the funds found their way into the accounts of the accused Ansari, this court finds him not entitled for a bail at this stage, the high court had said.

The high court had also mentioned in its order that the money trail links Ansari with the movement of funds to and from the two firms -- M/s Vikas Construction and M/s Aaghaaz. The firms, the ED has alleged, were used by Ansari for money laundering.

The ED had registered a case against Mr. Ansari, a Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) MLA, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 on the basis of three previous cases.

The apex court said that the trial court will impose conditions so that the accused cannot influence witnesses or tamper with evidence.

The other FIR arises out of allegations that Mukhtar Ansari had taken funds from the MLA fund to build a school though no school was built and the land is being used for agricultural purposes. In the third FIR, it has been alleged that Ansaris by using their influence usurped government land and constructed an illegal house.

His body was discovered among the rubble in Gaza, where Israeli forces had unknowingly come across him during a battle in Rafah. His identity was later confirmed through DNA, dental records, and fingerprints.Sinwar's remains were reportedly found with a bulletproof vest, grenades, and 40,000 shekels, according to Israeli military officials. Footage released by the Israeli military shows Sinwar’s final moments, captured by a drone deployed to survey the area. The footage showed the Hamas leader, visibly injured, attempting to throw a piece of wood at the drone in a desperate attempt to avoid detection. Moments later, another strike on the building caused it to collapse, killing Sinwar and two other militants.— LTC_Shoshani (@LTC_Shoshani) Sinwar’s involvement in the 7 October attack, which left over 1,200 people dead and resulted in the kidnapping of around 250 Israelis, made him one of Israel’s most-wanted individuals. He played a crucial role in orchestrating the surprise assault that triggered the current conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Vikas Yadav, 39, was employed by the Cabinet Secretariat, which houses India's foreign intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the federal prosecutors claimed in an indictment filed in a US court in New York.

Yadav faces murder-for-hire and money laundering charges in connection with his role in directing a foiled plot to kill Pannun. He ""remains at large"", the Department of Justice said.

Yadav had been identified only as 'CC-1' (co-conspirator) in the first indictment. On Thursday in New Delhi, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, responding to a query on the person identified in the indictment of the US Department of Justice (DoJ) in connection with the case, confirmed that the person is ""no longer an employee of the government of India"".

His co-conspirator Nikhil Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic last year and is languishing in a US jail after extradition. ""Today's charges demonstrate that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to target and endanger Americans and to undermine the rights to which every US citizen is entitled,"" US Attorney General Merrick B Garland said.

""The defendant, an Indian government employee, allegedly conspired with a criminal associate and attempted to assassinate a US citizen on American soil for exercising their First Amendment rights,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.

The Indian government has denied its association or involvement with such a plot to kill an American national on US soil. Following allegations by the US, New Delhi had set up an inquiry committee to investigate the matter. The US has expressed satisfaction on cooperation from India on this.

Unsealing of the second indictment comes within 48 hours of an Indian Enquiry Committee visiting here to have a meeting with an inter-agency team of officials from the FBI, Department of Justice and the State Department on these issues.

""We are satisfied with the cooperation. It continues to be an ongoing process. We continue to work with them on that, but we do appreciate the cooperation, and we appreciate them updating us on their investigation as we update them on ours,"" State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Wednesday.

Running into 18 pages, the indictment posts pictures of Yadav in a military dress and also gives a picture of two persons exchanging dollars in a car in New York, which federal prosecutors said was the money being paid to the alleged killer by a person on behalf of Gupta and Yadav to assassinate the Sikh separatist leader in New York.

The picture is dated June 9, 2023 The name of the Sikh separatist, a US citizen, is not mentioned in the indictment. ""By indicting RAW Official Vikash Yadav in “Murder For Hire” Plot, US Government has reassured its commitment to fundamental constitutional duty to protect the life, liberty and freedom of expression of the US Citizen at home and abroad,"" Pannun, general counsel to separatist Sikh for Justice, said in a statement after the indictment was released by the Department of Justice.

The damaging indictment alleges that Yadav along with his co-conspirator Nikhil Gupta plotted to kill the Sikh separatist leader in the summer of 2023. For this Gupta hired an individual to do the kill job. The unidentified individual, who was an informant to the FBI asked for $1,00,000 for the job and received $15,000 as an advance payment on June 9, 2023.

It was during the same month that President Joe Biden had invited Prime Minister Modi on a historic state visit, which took place on June 22. According to the indictment, Yadav told Gupta and the hired killer not to do the job immediately before or during the State visit."

The plot was foiled before the man could be killed.

An indictment against 39-year-old Vikash Yadav by the United States Department of Justice, unsealed on Thursday, identified him as a former “senior field officer” in the Research and Analysis Wing, India’s foreign intelligence service.

While prosecutors did not disclose the name of the target of the foiled plot, the Financial Times had last year identified him as Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, general counsel for the US-based group Sikhs for Justice.

On Thursday, the United States Department of Justice alleged that Yadav hired an Indian citizen named Nikhil Gupta to murder Pannun. The department accused Yadav of murder-for-hire and money laundering, but said that he currently “remains at large”.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed Yadav on its “wanted” list, and said that a federal arrest warrant was issued against him on October 10.

Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray said that the agency “will not tolerate acts of violence or other efforts to retaliate against those residing in the US for exercising their constitutionally protected rights”.

The indictment describes Panun as a vocal critic of the Indian government who leads a US -based organisation that advocates for Khalistan, an independent homeland for Sikhs sought by some groups. He is banned in India for his separatist activities, it noted.

The US Department of Justice alleged that in May 2023, Yadav agreed to pay a purported hitman $1,00,00, or Rs 84 lakh, to murder Pannun. The purported hitman, however, was in fact an undercover officer of the United States’ Drug Enforcement Administration.

Gupta travelled to Prague from India in June 2023 where was arrested by Czech authorities, and extradited to the United States. In June, he pleaded not guilty.

In November, the United States Attorney’s Office, Southern District of New York, announced that it filed “murder-for-hire charges” against Gupta, in connection with his alleged participation in the plot to assassinate Pannun.

On Thursday, the United States Department of Justice said in a statement that Yadav has been accused of “murder-for-hire and money laundering” charges for his alleged role in directing the failed murder plot against a citizen of the United States.

In a statement on Thursday, Pannun welcomed Yadav’s indictment, adding that the United States had done its “fundamental constitutional duty” to protect citizens, the Financial Times reported.

The development came days after an escalation in diplomatic tensions between India and Canada, resulting in the expulsion of diplomats from both sides.

The escalation of diplomatic tensions occurred after the Canadian government alleged the involvement of Indian government agents in the killing of another Sikh Separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar's near Vancouver in June 2023."
47,260143668,IANS,IANS,US charges former RAW officer Vikash Yadav over plot to murder Khalistani separatist Pannun,"New York, Oct 18 (IANS) US prosecutors have charged a former Senior Field Officer of RAW, Vikash Yadav, in an alleged murder-for-hire plot against Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun residing in New York City. In a strongly worded statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Thursday, “Today’s charges demonstrate that the Justice Department will not [&#8230;]",https://i2.wp.com/iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202310103067640.jpg?ssl=1,2024-10-18 05:23:31,"New York, Oct 18 (IANS) US prosecutors have charged a former Senior Field Officer of RAW, Vikash Yadav, in an alleged murder-for-hire plot against Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun residing in New York City.

In a strongly worded statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Thursday, “Today’s charges demonstrate that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to target and endanger Americans and to undermine the rights to which every US citizen is entitled”.

Describing Yadav as “an Indian government employee“, he said, “The Justice Department will be relentless in holding accountable any person — regardless of their position or proximity to power – who seeks to harm and silence American citizens”.

Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen who heads the Justice Department’s National Security Division, was more blunt: “To the governments around the world who may be considering such criminal activity and to the communities they would target, let there be no doubt that the Department of Justice is committed to disrupting and exposing these plots and to holding the wrongful actors accountable no matter who they are or where they reside”.

The charges filed against Yadav and his alleged co-conspirator Nikhil Gupta, were unsealed in the Federal Southern District of New York Court on Thursday.

The charges were framed by a grand jury, a panel of citizens that first decides if there is a prima facie case after the prosecution makes a preliminary presentation of the case.

Yadav faces three charges along with Gupta: conspiracy to hire a hitman, the actual “murder-for-hire” plot, and money laundering.

The charging document filed by the prosecutors makes a reference to the killing of a Canada-based Sikh separatist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in British Columbia, that has led to a serious deterioration of relations between India and Canada.

It says that Yadav told Gupta that “Nijjar was also the target” and “we have many targets”, and sent him a video of Nijjar’s body slumped in his car.

It appears that US law enforcement intercepted or had access to the electronic communications between Yadav and Gupta, even those on encrypted apps because extensive quotes from those are included in the court document.

Gupta, who was arrested in the Czech Republic at the request of the US, was extradited to the US in June and produced in court.

Many of the details in the court document filed by the prosecutors repeat the same narratives made in earlier documents filed against Gupta, but this time, Yadav is identified by name.

The indictment presents Yadav as the alleged mastermind who recruited Gupta to carry out the plot in exchange for helping him get criminal cases against him dismissed, and directed him.

It says that “Yadav recruited Gupta to orchestrate the assassination of the Victim in the United States” and that under Yadav’s “directions,” Gupta contacted a government “confidential source” who he thought was “a criminal associate”.

This person, in turn, put him in touch with the “purported hitman” who was, in fact, an undercover US law enforcement officer, unravelling the plot, according to the court document, which also included a photograph of Yadav dressed in military fatigues.

The charges were filed a day after an Indian Enquiry Committee set up to investigate the allegations visited Washington to discuss the case with US officials.

Judge Victor Marrero, who is presiding over the case against Yadav, has set a status conference on Friday when the prosecutors and the defence lawyer are to discuss handling the evidence and proceeding with the case.

The 18-page document filed by the prosecutors does not name any other Indian official.

Neither does it name Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the leader of the separatist group, Sikhs for Justice, who was reportedly the target of the alleged plot.

It only says that the “Victim” was “an attorney and political activist who is a US citizen of Indian origin living in New York City” and leads “a US-based organisation that advocates for the secession of Punjab” to establish Khalistan.

The Indian government has banned the “Victim” and his separatist organisation, it noted.

The document says that Yadav, who used the aliases Amant and Vikas, was “employed by the Cabinet Secretariat of the Government of India which houses India’s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW)”.

Yadav has described himself as a “Senior Field Officer” with responsibilities in “Security Management” and “Intelligence” and has served in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), “India’s largest paramilitary force”, according to the court paper.

He said that he was an “assistant commandant” in CRPF with 135 men under his command and that he had received “paratrooper”, “battlecraft”, and counterintelligence training, the document said.

He also gave his address as “CGO Complex” in New Delhi, where according to the document RAW is headquartered.

It said that in June 2023, they agreed with the “hitman” on a payment of $100,000 to allegedly kill the “victim” and Yadav and Gupta arranged through an “associate of Yadav” to give $15,000 as advance.

Yadav gave Gupta the details about the “Victim”, including his address in New York and his phone numbers, which were passed on to the undercover agent, the indictment said.

The document said that the alleged plot began around May 6 last year with Yadav sending Gupta a message on an encrypted app, “This is Vikas … save my name as Aman”.

A few minutes later, he received a call from Yadav who told him that he had a “target in New York” and another in “California”, and Gupta replied, “We will hit all our targets”, it said.

A week later, Yadav assured him that he had “spoke(n) to his boss” about Yadav’s case and it was closed, and they proceeded with the alleged plot, according to the court document.

The document says that during a video call, Yadav turned the camera towards three men in business attire at a conference room and said, “We are all counting on you”.

Yadav discussed at length how the money was to be transferred and also told him to hold off on the plot during the time of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US last June.

Gupta is being held without bail in a notorious federal jail, the Metropolitan Detention Center, where the rapper Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs is also held."

Siddaramaiah is facing Lokayukta and ED probes into alleged irregularities in the allotment of 14 sites to his wife by the MUDA.

In the MUDA site allotment case, it is alleged that 14 compensatory sites were allotted to Siddaramaiah’s wife in an upmarket area in Mysuru (Vijayanagar Layout 3rd and 4th stages), which had higher property value as compared to the location of her land which had been “acquired” by MUDA.

The MUDA had allotted plots to Parvathi under a 50:50 ratio scheme in lieu of 3.16 acres of her land, where it developed a residential layout.

Under the controversial scheme, MUDA allotted 50 per cent of developed land to the land losers in lieu of undeveloped land acquired from them for forming residential layouts.

It is alleged that Parvathi had no legal title over this 3.16 acres of land at survey number 464 of Kasare village, Kasaba hobli of Mysuru taluk.

After the controversy broke out, Parvathi had announced that she was returning the allotted plots to MUDA.

The CM had denied any wrongdoing by him or his family, saying the opposition was “scared” of him and had noted that it is the first such “political case” against him.

Following the controversy, MUDA chairman K Marigowda had also quit from his post on Wednesday, citing health reasons."

Officials have yet to reveal the identities of the deceased and those receiving treatment.On Thursday, Director General of Police Alok Raj announced that two special investigation teams (SITs) have been formed in response to the incident. One team will investigate the criminal aspects locally, while another SIT from the Department of Prohibition in Patna will conduct a comprehensive study of recent hooch incidents to formulate a future action plan.So far, police have arrested around 15 individuals in connection with the incidents in both districts. In light of the tragedy, the administrations of Siwan and Saran have suspended three chowkidars from the Maghar, Auriya, and Ibrahimpur areas. A senior police officer mentioned that show-cause notices have been issued to at least five police personnel.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has sought updates on the investigation into the suspected hooch deaths in Siwan and Saran. He directed the DGP to personally oversee the situation and ensure ""strict action is taken against those involved in the crime."" The CM has also instructed Vinod Singh Gunjiyal, Secretary of the Department of Prohibition and Excise, and the Bihar Police ADG (Prohibition) to visit the affected areas for a thorough investigation.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav commented on the incident in a post on X, stating, ""Bihar CM Nitish Kumar should be held responsible for the latest hooch deaths in the state. It's mass murder. The liquor ban exemplifies the institutional corruption of the Nitish Kumar-led government. If the liquor ban is in place, it is the government's duty to enforce it effectively. But that's not happening... the liquor ban is a complete failure in Bihar today. Due to the unholy nexus between ruling politicians, police, and the liquor mafia, a black market for illegal liquor worth over Rs 30,000 crore has flourished in Bihar. According to state government records, over 300 people have died due to spurious liquor consumption. Who is their killer?""— yadavtejashwi (@yadavtejashwi) In response to the incident, Bihar BJP chief Dilip Jaiswal assured reporters that all those responsible would be apprehended swiftly. ""This incident is tragic… all those behind it will be caught very soon. The NDA government in the state is committed to enforcing the liquor ban effectively. When liquor was sold in Bihar, numerous crimes were reported, especially against women. Those advocating for the removal of the liquor ban have ties to the liquor mafia. Our government cannot entertain generating revenue by lifting the liquor ban, as some leaders demand,"" Jaiswal stated."

A proposed plan of arrangement developed through mediation was filed in an Ontario court Thursday after a prolonged five-year process.

The companies — JTI-Macdonald Corp., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges and Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. — sought creditor protection in Ontario in early 2019 after they lost an appeal in a landmark court battle in Quebec.

The Ontario court put all legal proceedings against the companies on hold as they tried to work out a deal with their creditors, which include the plaintiffs in two Quebec class-action lawsuits as well as provincial governments seeking to recover smoking-related health-care costs.

Under the proposed plan filed Thursday, provinces and territories would receive payments over time, with roughly $6 billion to be paid out when the deal is implemented.

The Quebec plaintiffs would file claims for compensation of up to $100,000 each.

The proposed plan also includes more than $2.5 billion for smokers in other provinces and territories who were diagnosed with lung cancer, throat cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease between March 2015 and March 2019. They would be eligible for up to $60,000 each.

Bruce W. Johnston, one of the lawyers for the Quebec plaintiffs, said the proposal is “historic and unprecedented” because it allows for the compensation of smokers as well as governments.

“When we took this case, there had never been a single plaintiff who had received a single penny from a tobacco company,” he said Thursday.

“We took this case in 1998 and as a result of our case, not only will tens of thousands of victims be compensated by the tobacco industry in Canada, most of them in Quebec, but also governments are going to be sharing $24 billion.”

The plaintiffs have endured lengthy delays and now they can finally see that there’s “probably a light at the end of the tunnel and that they will receive compensation,” he said.

While many of the class-action members died before they could receive any money from the companies, their successors — and in some cases, their successors’ successors — will be eligible for compensation, he said.

The proposed deal would also see the companies pour more than $1 billion into a foundation to fight tobacco-related diseases. That amount includes $131 million taken from the money allocated to the Quebec plaintiffs.

The proposal must still go through several steps before it can be put into action, including a vote by creditors and approval by the court. 

The mediation was confidential, so the class-action members couldn’t know how things were progressing and many didn’t understand why it was taking so long, Johnston said.

Several health-care groups argued the lack of transparency surrounding the talks would benefit the companies at the expense of other stakeholders.

As recently as last month, three groups — Action on Smoking & Health, Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada and the Quebec Coalition for Tobacco Control — said recent court filings suggested the provinces had agreed to a process that would give the companies veto power over the final deal.

The groups have consistently urged the provinces to impose regulations and smoking-reduction measures as part of a deal with the companies.

Some organizations, including the Canadian Cancer Society, were also calling for a deal to involve the public disclosure of internal company documents.

Rob Cunningham, a lawyer for the Canadian Cancer Society, said the proposed deal is “the most significant proposed settlement in the world outside of the United States” in a case of its kind so far.

But unlike the global settlement reached with tobacco companies in the U.S. in the late 1990s, it doesn’t include policy measures aimed at reducing tobacco use or any public disclosure of documents, he said.

Derrick Dearman, 36, was pronounced dead at 6:14 p.m. Thursday at Holman prison in southern Alabama. He pleaded guilty in a rampage that began when he broke into the home where his estranged girlfriend had taken refuge.

Strapped to a gurney in the Alabama execution chamber, Dearman spoke to the family members of the victims and to his own family in his final statement. “Forgive me. This is not for me. This is for you,” he said to the victims’ families before adding, “I’ve taken so much.” He closed by telling his own family, “Y’all already know I love y’all.”

Dearman had dropped his appeals this year and asked that his execution go forward. “I am guilty,” he wrote in an April letter to a judge, adding that “it’s not fair to the victims or their families to keep prolonging the justice that they so rightly deserve.”

Dearman’s execution was one of two planned Thursday in the U.S. Robert Roberson was scheduled to be the nation’s first person put to death for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome, in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, but a judge granted a request from Texas lawmakers to delay his execution.

Chelsea Reed, who was married to Justin Reed, was pregnant when she was killed. All of the victims were related by blood or marriage.

In a statement read by the Alabama prison commissioner, a man who lost his daughter, sister and brother in the killings, wrote there were no words to describe the impact the murders had on him and his family. He said Dearman got to say a final goodbye to his family, but they did not.

“I so long for a final goodbye to my daughter and I would have loved to meet my grandchild,” Bryant Henry Randall, the father of Chelsea Randall Reed wrote. He said his siblings did not get to see their children grow up.

“I was stripped in many ways of happiness and the bond of family by your senseless act,” he wrote of Dearman.

Robert Brown, the father of Robert Lee Brown, told reporters that his family will “suffer for the rest of their lives.”

“This don’t bring nothing back,” he said. “I can’t get my son back or any of them back.”

The execution started about 5:58 p.m., but it is unclear when the drugs began flowing. At one point, Dearman raised his head and looked around the chamber as if to inquire when they were starting. He soon after appeared to lose consciousness.

His left arm moved slightly after a guard performed a consciousness check — which involves shouting his name and pinching his arm — to make sure he is not awake when the final lethal drugs are given. Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said Dearman was not awake and the arm movement was not a sign of consciousness.

When the curtains to the viewing room closed at about 6:08 p.m., his father, who was in the same viewing room as media witnesses, sobbed and repeatedly called out his son’s name.

The day before the killing, Joseph Turner, the brother of Dearman’s girlfriend, brought her to their home after Dearman became abusive toward her, according to a judge’s sentencing order.

Dearman’s former lawyers had questioned if he was competent to make the decision to plead guilty.

How to play Connections

Playing is easy. Winning is hard. Look at the 16 words and mentally assign them to related groups of four. Click on the four words you think go together. The groups are coded by color, though you don't know what goes where until you see the answers. The yellow group is the easiest, then green, then blue, and purple is the toughest. Look at the words carefully and think about related terms. Sometimes the connection has to do with just a part of the word. Once, four words were grouped because each started with the name of a rock band, including ""Rushmore"" and ""Journeyman.""

The rules are pretty much the same as the regular game. You're given 16 words and asked to put them into four groups that are somehow connected. The main difference is that all the words and categories have some kind of sports tie-in. Sometimes the categories seem obvious, but the game attempts to trick you by using sports-related words that can fit into more than one group. And the four groups of words have different difficulty levels. Yellow is the easiest and purple the hardest, but you won't know which color group is which until you solve the puzzle.

Kim’s comments at an army headquarters came after North Korea this week confirmed that it revised its constitution to define South Korea as “a hostile state” and blew up front-line road and rail links that were once connected to the South. 

The steps punctuated Kim’s calls for North Korea to abandon its longstanding goals of reconciling with the South and reflect his intent to escalate tensions and increase leverage amid a deepening stalemate in diplomacy. Analysts see increasing risks of possible clashes along the rivals’ tense border areas, although it would be highly unlikely for the North to contemplate full-scale attacks in the face of superior U.S. and South Korean forces. 

During a visit to the headquarters of the North Korean People’s Army’s 2nd Corps on Thursday, Kim stressed to troops the importance of understanding that any use of offensive force against the South would constitute a “legitimate retaliatory action against the hostile country, not the fellow countrymen.”

He said the North’s detonation of the border road and rail sections on Tuesday demonstrated the North’s resolve to cut off persistent “evil” relations with the South, which “lasted century after century and the complete removal of the useless awareness about fellow countrymen and unreasonable idea of reunification.”

He said the event was also a declaration that his troops wouldn’t hesitate to use physical force against the South, an “apparent hostile country,” if it violates North Korea’s sovereignty, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said.

South Korea had no immediate comment on Kim’s remarks. 

North Korea has been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea in recent weeks, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang this month and threatening to attack if it happens again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea will face an overwhelming response that would “end its regime” if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. 

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022, as Kim used Russia’s war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told the Associated Press earlier this month that North Korea will likely attempt to ramp up pressure with major provocations around the U.S. presidential elections in November, possibly including a long-range missile test or a nuclear test detonation, to grab Washington's attention."

 North Korea confirmed Thursday that its recently revised constitution defines South Korea as “a hostile state” for the first time, two days after it blew up front-line road and rail links that once connected the country with the South. The back-to-back developments indicate North Korea is intent on escalating animosities against South Korea, increasing the danger of possible clashes at their tense border areas.

Bo Nix passed for 164 yards and ran for 75 yards for Denver (4-3), which dominated statistically. The Broncos outgained New Orleans 389 yards to 271 while sending the Saints (2-5) to their fifth straight defeat.

Payton coached the Saints from 2006-21, leading them to their only Super Bowl triumph after the 2009 season. His New Orleans teams had just two losses at home by 20 points or more, something the Saints have already done twice this year.

“It was hard coming here because there were so many of those memories. I tried to downplay it best I could but it’s about the players. And they played their tail off,” Payton said. “And I felt bad, New Orleans is nicked up, got a lot of injuries.”

With Saints quarterback Derek Carr (oblique) missing his second straight game, there were rookies under center for both teams.

Spencer Rattler made his second straight start for New Orleans and his lack of experience was exacerbated by injuries all across the the offense.

The Saints were missing top receivers Chris Olave (concussion) and Rashid Shaheed (knee), the latter going on injured reserve earlier in the day. Two starting linemen, center Erik McCoy (groin) and guard Cesar Ruiz (knee), were out. Versatile tight end Taysom Hill (ribs) missed his third straight game.

Rattler was overwhelmed by a Denver defense that came in ranked fourth in the NFL in yards allowed.

He was 25 of 35 for 172 yards, rushed for 34 yards and lost two fumbles, the second of which was returned 52 yards for a touchdown by Cody Barton in the fourth quarter. Rattler appeared shaken up on the play and was replaced by Jake Haener, who connected with Cedric Wilson for New Orleans’ lone TD.

Barton forced Rattler’s first fumble, which led to one of former Saint Wil Lutz’s four field goals. 

Rattler was sacked six times, once by linebacker Nik Bonitto, who had a sack for a fifth straight game.

New Orleans’ defense, meanwhile, could not come up with any momentum-turning plays.

Tryann Mathieu uncharacteristically dropped an errant pass by Nix that sailed directly to the veteran defensive back late in the second quarter. That allowed the the Broncos to close out the half with a field goal and a 16-3 lead.

NEW ORLEANS — Javonte Williams rushed for two touchdowns and the Denver Broncos triumphed in Coach Sean Payton’s return to New Orleans, beating the banged-up and reeling Saints, 33-10, on Thursday night.

Bo Nix passed for 164 yards and ran for 75 yards for Denver (4-3), which dominated statistically. The Broncos outgained New Orleans 389 yards to 271 while sending the Saints (2-5) to their fifth straight defeat.

Payton coached the Saints from 2006-21, leading them to their only Super Bowl triumph after the 2009 season. His New Orleans teams had just two losses at home by 20 points or more, something the Saints have already done twice this year.

“It was hard coming here because there were so many of those memories. I tried to downplay it best I could but it’s about the players. And they played their tail off,” Payton said. “And I felt bad, New Orleans is nicked up, got a lot of injuries.”

With Saints quarterback Derek Carr (oblique) missing his second straight game, there were rookies under center for both teams.

Spencer Rattler made his second straight start for New Orleans and his lack of experience was exacerbated by injuries all across the the offense.

The Saints were missing top receivers Chris Olave (concussion) and Rashid Shaheed (knee), the latter going on injured reserve earlier in the day. Two starting linemen, center Erik McCoy (groin) and guard Cesar Ruiz (knee), were out. Versatile tight end Taysom Hill (ribs) missed his third straight game.

Rattler was overwhelmed by a Denver defense that came in ranked fourth in the NFL in yards allowed.

He was 25 of 35 for 172 yards, rushed for 34 yards and lost two fumbles, the second of which was returned 52 yards for a touchdown by Cody Barton in the fourth quarter. Rattler appeared shaken up on the play and was replaced by Jake Haener, who connected with Cedric Wilson for New Orleans’ lone touchdown.

Barton forced Rattler’s first fumble, which led to one of former Saint Wil Lutz’s four field goals.

Rattler was sacked six times, once by linebacker Nik Bonitto, who had a sack for a fifth straight game.

New Orleans’ defense, meanwhile, could not come up with any momentum-turning plays.

Tryann Mathieu uncharacteristically dropped an errant pass by Nix that sailed directly to the veteran defensive back late in the second quarter. That allowed the the Broncos to close out the half with a field goal and a 16-3 lead.

The Broncos made the best of the injury-riddled New Orleans Saints, who looked just that part. Denver went out and earned a 33-10 win on Thursday night at the Superdome. Broncos running back Javonte Williams found the burst he desperately needed, finding the end zone twice in the game, while kicker Will Lutz went 3-for-3 on field goal tries in the first half. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The second half started pretty much the same way the first half went, as Lutz drilled his fourth field goal of the night. On their next drive, Williams found the end zone a second time to go up 26-3. For good measure, in the fourth quarter, Denver returned a fumble to the house for a score, pretty much icing it with a 33-3 lead. The Saints looked like a team who had their backup quarterback in the game and their top two targets out — which is exactly what they were. Spencer Rattler started as Derek Carr nursed an injury, and both Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed were inactive. RAVENS FAN SEEN IN VIRAL FIGHT VIDEO IDENTIFIED, WARRANT ISSUED FOR ARREST, POLICE SAY Rattler threw for just 172 yards on 25-for-35 passing — Bub Means, Foster Moreau, and Alvin Kamara each had six catches. As for the other side, Williams finally broke out, rushing for 88 yards on his 14 carries, two of which were scores. Bo Nix also was effective on the ground, running 10 times for 75 yards. The game marked Sean Payton's first game in New Orleans since leaving them after the 2021 season — he was their coach for 16 years, going 152-89 with them and winning Super Bowl XLIV. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Denver is now surprisingly over .500, and next week they will host the Carolina Panthers.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said Sinwar, considered the mastermind of the 7 October attack just over a year ago, had been “eliminated” in southern Gaza on Wednesday.

The Israeli military also released drone footage which it said showed the final moments of the Hamas leader before he was killed.

In the video Sinwar, 62 and deemed responsible for last year’s massacre of 1,200 people at the hands of Hamas militants in southern Israel, appears injured as he sits in a ruined building.

Sitting on a chair, his face covered in a scarf, he is seen trying to throw an object at the drone.

How the battle unfolded

As more details emerge, it appears the killing was the result of a chance encounter rather than a targeted operation.

Israeli officials said he Hamas leader, who was being hunted by intelligence services for the past year, was killed after he emerged from the group’s underground tunnel system as he tried to escape to a safer location.

They said he was found by infantry soldiers searching an area in the Tal El Sultan area of southern Gaza, where they believed senior members of Hamas were located.

The troops saw three suspected militants moving between buildings and opened fire, leading to a gunfight during which Sinwar escaped into a ruined building.

According to accounts in Israeli media, tank shells and a missile were fired at the building.

Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said at this stage he was only identified as a fighter.

Troops entered the ruined building and found him with a weapon, a flak jacket and 40,000 shekels ($10,731.63).

“He tried to escape and our forces eliminated him,” Rear Admiral Hagari said during a televised briefing.

His death was confirmed following DNA tests and other checks, like dental records.

There was no immediate confirmation from Hamas of Sinwar’s death – but sources within the group have said they have seen indications to suggest he was indeed killed.

According to four Israeli defence officials quoted by The New York Times, Sinwar was killed by a unit of trainee squad commanders who unexpectedly came upon him while carrying out a routine operation in the area.

The Pentagon said US forces had no role in the killing.

Spokesperson Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder said: “This was an Israeli operation. There (were) no US forces directly involved”.

He said the US had contributed intelligence relating “to hostage recovery and the tracking and locating of Hamas leaders who have been responsible for holding hostages. And so certainly that contributes in general to the picture.”

No telephones

In the last months of his life, Sinwar was believed to have stopped using telephones and other communication equipment that might have allowed Israel’s intelligence to track him down.

He was believed to be hiding in the vast network of tunnels that Hamas dug beneath Gaza over the past two decades, but many were uncovered by Israeli troops during the war.

The head of Israel’s military, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said Israel’s hunt for Sinwar had driven him “to act like a fugitive, causing him to change locations multiple times”.

Sinwar’s death is a huge blow to Hamas.

The group’s military commander Mohammed Deif was killed in an Israeli airstrike on 13 July."

The passport of a United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration teacher was reportedly found on the body of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar — the Oct. 7 mastermind who was killed by Israeli forces on Wednesday, photos show. 

An apparent passport that belongs to Hani Zourob — a teacher with the embattled UNRWA — was reportedly discovered Thursday by Israeli officials on the body of the terrorist leader, according to photos posted on X by an Israeli correspondent for KAN News.

It was not immediately clear if the passport was a real or fake document.

The UNRWA has been under fire following reports that at least a dozen of its staffers assisted in the terrorist attack on Israel, but the teacher, who escaped Gaza via Rafah in April, is reportedly living in Egypt, according to the correspondent. 

Sinwar was killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza, along with two other Hamas terrorists who were traveling with him, more than a year after his orchestrated attack on the Jewish state that erupted into war. 

Israeli officials confirmed the deaths on Thursday.

An Israeli drone captured the Hamas chief’s last minutes alive as he attempted to throw a piece of wood in a futile attempt to take out the device before he was killed. 

IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters on Thursday that Sinwar was likely on the move trying to escape north amid the Israeli military’s advancement in Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had fled to earlier this year. 

Sinwar’s death has been hailed by US and Israeli officials as a major blow to Hamas with the potential of ending the war in Gaza and freeing the remaining 97 hostages who were abducted on Oct. 7.

Retired Senior Chief Petty Officer Rob O’Neill said Israel’s strategy of targeting leaders of the terrorist group was the right one.

Israel said Sinwar was killed on Thursday when he was cornered in a building in Gaza by Israeli soldiers who spotted Hamas soldiers inside.

After an exchange of fire, a tank shell was said to have hit the structure and collapsed it.

Graphic images then circulated online purporting to show the body of the Hamas leader with Israeli soldiers surrounding it.

‘What Israel is doing right now is they’re showing us how to win a war. They’re taking out the top leaders. They’re going to keep doing it,’ O’Neill told Newsmax.

‘And they’re proving to everyone, including like, even right now, our president will say, ‘Well, now he’s dead, we can work on a cease-fire.

‘You don’t don’t let someone start a war and then whine about a cease-fire… Israel ‘did a great job, and I couldn’t be more proud.’

O’Neill said killing Sinwar ‘takes away a lot of [Hamas’] abilities’ and was a big morale boost for Israel a year after the terrorist group’s massacre on October 7, 2023.

‘This is huge for them. And I love that they were able to do it with soldiers. So the last thing that Yahya saw was probably the Israeli flag,’ he said.

O’Neill said Iran was still the biggest enemy, but that ‘our supposed ally in Qatar’ needed to round up the Hamas leaders hiding on its soil and give them to Israel.

The former special forces operative felt the same way about the 9/11 plotters, telling DailyMail.com in August they should have been executed years ago. 

O’Neill added he would have carried out the death penalty himself and criticized the plea deal that spared their lives.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed – the architect of the 2001 plot that killed almost 3,000 people – and two accomplices Walid Bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi accepted life sentences to avoid a lengthy criminal trial and the death penalty. 

O’Neill said the agreement was a slap in the face for the families of the 2,657 American victims who waited 23 years for justice.

Family members of the victims reacted with fury as news of the plea deal emerged, on a day when more evidence of Saudi Arabia’s complicity in 9/11 was revealed in a New York courtroom.

Montana native O’Neill and members of SEAL Team Six stormed Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2, 2011, and cornered him.

He claims he shot the most wanted man in the world in the head, ending a global manhunt that had consumed the West for years.

He came forward in 2014 and named himself as the man who fired the kill shots."

The post King Charles III&#8217;s Visit Rekindles Australia&#8217;s Debate on Ending Ties to the British Monarchy appeared first on The National Herald.",https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/king-charles.jpg,2024-10-18 01:08:59,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — King Charles III and Queen Camilla will arrive in Sydney on Friday for the first Australian visit by a reigning monarch in more than a decade, a trip that has rekindled debate about the nation’s constitutional links to Britain.

The Sydney Opera House’s iconic sails will be illuminated with images of previous royal visits to welcome the couple, whose six-day trip will be brief by royal standards. Charles, 75, is being treated for cancer, which led to the scaled-down itinerary.

He is only the second reigning British monarch to visit Australia. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, became the first 70 years ago.

While the welcome will be warm, Australia’s national and state leaders want the royals removed from their constitution.

Monarchists expect the visit will strengthen Australians’ connection to their sovereign. Opponents hope for a rejection of the concept that someone from the other side of the world is Australia’s head of state.

The Australian Republic Movement, which campaigns for an Australian citizen to replace the British monarch as head of state, likens the royal visit to a touring act in the entertainment industry.

The ARM this week launched what it calls a campaign to “Wave Goodbye to Royal Reign with Monarchy: The Farewell Oz Tour!”

ARM co-chair Esther Anatolitis said royal visits to Australia were “something of a show that comes to town.”

“Unfortunately, it is a reminder that Australia’s head of state isn’t full-time, isn’t Australian. It’s a part-time person based overseas who’s the head of state of numerous places,” Anatolitis told the AP.

“We say to Charles and Camilla: ‘Welcome, we hope you’re enjoying our country and good health and good spirits.’ But we also look forward to this being the final tour of a sitting Australian monarch and that when they come back to visit soon, we look forward to welcoming them as visiting dignitaries,” she added.

Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, which campaigns for Australia’s constitutional links to Britain to be maintained, expects reaction to the royal couple will be overwhelmingly positive.

“Something like the royal visit brings the king closer in the minds of people, because we have an absent monarchy,” Benwell told the AP.

“The visit by the king brings it home that Australia is a constitutional monarchy and it has a king,” he added.

Benwell is critical of the premiers of all six states, who have declined invitations to attend a reception for Charles in the national capital Canberra.

The premiers each explained that they had more pressing engagements on the day such as cabinet meetings and overseas travel.

“It would be virtually incumbent upon the premiers to be in Canberra to meet him and pay their respects,” Benwell said. “To not attend can be considered to be a snub, because this is not a normal visit. This is the first visit of a king ever to Australia.”

Charles was drawn into Australia’s republic debate months before his visit.

The Australian Republic Movement wrote to Charles in December last year requesting a meeting in Australia and for the king to advocate their cause. Buckingham Palace politely wrote back in March to say the king’s meetings would be decided upon by the Australian government. A meeting with the ARM does not appear on the official itinerary.

“Whether Australia becomes a republic is … a matter for the Australian public to decide,” said the letter from Buckingham Palace.

The Associated Press has seen copies of both letters.

Australians decided in a referendum in 1999 to retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. That result is widely regarded as a consequence of disagreement about how a president should be chosen rather than majority support for a monarch.

After visiting Sydney and Canberra, which are 250 kilometers (155 miles apart), Charles will then travel to Samoa to open the annual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

When his mother made the last of her 16 journeys to Australia in 2011 at the age of 85, she visited Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne on the east coast before opening the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the west coast city of Perth.

Elizabeth’s first grueling Australian tour at the age of 27 took in scores of far-flung Outback towns; an estimated 75% of the nation’s population turned out to see her.

Australia then had a racially discriminatory policy that favored British immigrants. Immigration policy has been non-discriminatory since 1973 .

Anatolitis noted that Australia is far more multicultural now, with most of the population either born overseas or with a overseas-born parent.

“In the ’50s, we didn’t have that global interconnectedness that we have now,” she said."

In the wake of Liam Payne‘s tragic death, we’re learning more and more about what he was going through in the days leading up to the tragedy. And it would be overwhelming for anyone.

First there was the legal drama with his ex-fiancée Maya Henry. She had already made some pretty upsetting allegations against him. And it sounded like that was about to get a lot worse as she was considering taking legal action.

But it wasn’t just personal issues hitting the One Direction singer. It was professional, too. According to a shocking report on Thursday, his record label had dropped him! Just days before his death!

Universal Music Group put out a somber statement after the news of Liam’s unexpected passing. They wrote:

“We are devastated by the tragic passing of Liam Payne. His legacy will live on through his music and the countless fans he inspired and who adored him. We send our deepest condolences to Liam’s family and loved ones.”

The even put a little white dove emoji.

— Universal Music Group (@UMG) October 17, 2024

But according to multiple sources spilling to DailyMail.com, Liam was no longer with Universal — because they’d just let him go! One insider told them:

“Liam’s advance was massive and he didn’t recoup. Out of all of the One Direction boys, Liam was on the wrong path musically.”

Liam signed with the label Capitol Records, a subsidiary of Universal, back in 2016 after the breakup of 1D. In eight years, he’s only released the one album, LP1, in 2019. Though his first solo single, Strip That Down, hit number one on Billboard, like the rest of 1D’s first efforts, he never broke the top 20 again.

He obviously never quite hit the level of success that Harry Styles did… or even Zayn Malik and Niall Horan. So if Capitol/Universal expected a Harry and gave him that level of advance… It seems they weren’t willing to continue their bet on him as sources claimed the release of his second full album was put on hold even before he was officially dropped.

To learn Liam had just been dealt a career blow like this… What a rough time he was going through. Another source told the outlet:

“It is like all of Liam’s music career that he had built up since he went solo eight years ago was crumbling, there was very little left for him. It must have absolutely devastated him.”

Wow. He may have seemed like he was having the time of his life from the outside, but the more we’re learning the worse it sounds like everything was going for Liam. So sad…

We don’t know — and may never know — how much these struggles contributed to what happened to Liam. But we hope he knew how beloved he was by so many.

A source told the Daily Mail Thursday that Universal Music axed the former One Direction star from their roster as his solo career was floundering. 

“Liam’s advance was massive and he didn’t recoup [it],” the insider claimed. “Out of all of the One Direction boys, Liam was on the wrong path musically.”

Payne’s sophomore album was reportedly put on hold before the record label cut ties. 

The “Strip That Down” singer signed with Capitol Records, which is owned by Universal Music, in 2016 after One Direction announced their indefinite hiatus in 2015.

Furthermore, the Daily Mail reported Payne’s publicity team resigned earlier in October. 

Page Six reached out to Universal Music and reps for the musician for comment. 

Universal Music posted a tribute to Payne on Thursday, writing that they are “devastated” by his sudden passing.

“His legacy will live on through his music and the countless fans he inspired and who adored him,” the statement added. “We send our deepest condolences to Liam’s family and loved ones.”

Prior to his death, the pop star was also said to be feeling “extremely overwhelmed by all of the legal issues” with his ex-fiancée, Maya Henry, who reportedly sent him a cease-and-desist letter last week.

The news of the legal action came after the model claimed in a TikTok video that Payne had been frequently contacting her and her family after their breakup — despite him being in a new relationship.

Furthermore, on Monday’s episode of “The Internet Is Dead” podcast, Henry, 23, accused her ex-fiancé of using his poor mental health as a “manipulation tactic” to get her to speak to him. 

“He would always message me ever since we broke up [saying], ‘Oh, I’m not well,'” she claimed. “He would always play with death and be like, ‘Well, I’m going to die. I’m not doing well.'”

Eerily enough, she wrote about a person falling off a balcony in her fiction novel, “Looking Forward,” which was released earlier this year and inspired by her real life.

Payne died from multiple traumas that resulted in internal and external bleeding after he fell off a third-story balcony at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Wednesday evening. 

He was reportedly acting “erratically” and trashing his hotel room before he died.

Payne was allegedly causing such a scene that the hotel manager called emergency services shortly before his death as he feared for the singer’s life.

“We have a guest who is [allegedly] high and drunk; and when he is conscious, he is destroying his room and we need you to send someone, please,” the employee said on the phone. 

“We need you to send someone urgently because I don’t know if his life is in danger.”"

The singer’s public relations representative also dropped him, resigning earlier this month, according to the publication. 

The former One Direction member plunged to his death from a third-floor hotel balcony in Argentina on Wednesday. He was 31.

Universal Music Group posted a tribute to the singer on social media after the news of his death. 

“We are devastated by the tragic passing of Liam Payne. His legacy will live on through his music and the countless fans he inspired and who adored him,” the company wrote. “We send our deepest condolences to Liam’s family and loved ones.”

Payne was reportedly “acting erratic” in the lobby of the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires before his death. Bystanders said he smashed his laptop and had to be carried back to his hotel room while the hotel manager frantically called 911 worried that the pop star — who he said was under the influence of drugs and alcohol — could hurt himself or worse. 

“We need you to send someone urgently because, well, I don’t know if this guest’s life is at risk. They must be in a room that has a balcony,” the hotel manager told the emergency dispatcher. “And well, we’re a little bit worried he’ll do something, that he’ll put his life at risk.”

It’s not clear if Payne’s death was intentional or accidental, but Security Ministry of Buenos Aires representative Pablo Policicchio declared that the musician “had thrown himself from the balcony of his room.”

The dad of one fractured his skull upon impact and is believed to have died instantly, according to medical officials. His body will soon undergo a complete autopsy. 

Payne leaves behind his 7-year-old son Bear, with his ex Cheryl Cole."

The move threatens to escalate tensions with New Delhi just days after Canada expelled six diplomats in a bitter dispute over an extrajudicial killing.

The Department of Justice said Vikash Yadav, described as a “senior field officer” in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration, directed a “murder-for-hire” scheme from India.

According to the DoJ, the plot involved paying a hitman $100,000 for assassinating a US-Canadian citizen who was part of a separatist movement advocating an independent Sikh state.

Although prosecutors did not name the target of the foiled plot, the Financial Times last year confirmed it was Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, general counsel for US-based group Sikhs for Justice. 

The Indian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.

In charges unsealed on Thursday, prosecutors claimed Yadav had overseen a scheme to kill Pannun, providing his address in New York and his phone numbers to the would-be assassin, who was an undercover US agent.

In June 2023, Yadav was also allegedly communicating about the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, an associate of Pannun’s and a fellow Sikh activist, in a suburb of Vancouver, Canada. 

Yadav sent a video of Nijjar’s body to an associate, prosecutors said, and days later forwarded a news article about Pannun, writing: “[i]t’s [a] priority now”.

In a statement on Thursday, Pannun said the US had done its “fundamental constitutional duty” to protect citizens.

“The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism, which has become a challenge to America’s sovereignty and threat to freedom of speech and democracy, which unequivocally proves that India believes in using bullets while pro-Khalistan Sikhs believe in ballots,” he said. 

Pannun described Yadav as a “mid-tier soldier” assigned to conduct a murder plot under orders from India’s national security adviser, Ajit Doval.

The charges against Yadav come as tensions between Canada and India reached a new high, with the countries expelling each other’s diplomats earlier this week.

The two nations have been embroiled in a bitter dispute since Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last year that there were “credible allegations” of Indian government involvement in Nijjar’s death — claims that have been vigorously denied by New Delhi.

US assistant attorney-general Matthew Olsen said on Thursday the charges against Yadav were “a grave example of the increase in lethal plotting and other forms of violent transnational repression targeting diaspora communities in the United States”. 

He added: “To the governments around the world who may be considering such criminal activity and to the communities they would target, let there be no doubt that the Department of Justice is committed to disrupting and exposing these plots and to holding the wrongful actors accountable.”"

The indictment against Vikash Yadav, unsealed in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday, points to a direct link between the Indian government and what prosecutors say was a murder-for-hire scheme on American soil.

The Justice Department first announced charges in the case last year, indicting an Indian national and alleged drug and weapons trafficker, Nikhil Gupta. That indictment also referred to an unnamed Indian government official whom prosecutors said directed the scheme.

The new indictment unsealed Thursday identifies that official as Yadav and makes him a co-defendant in the case. Yadav and Gupta each face charges of murder-for-hire conspiracy, murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Gupta was arrested last year in the Czech Republic and extradited to the U.S. He has pleaded not guilty. Yadav, meanwhile, remains at large, according to the Justice Department.

“The Justice Department will be relentless in holding accountable any person — regardless of their position or proximity to power — who seeks to harm and silence American citizens,” Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement.

The alleged target

The target of the alleged plot was Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen, lawyer and political activist. He is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice and an advocate for the creation of a Sikh state carved out from northern India.

Pannun welcomed the indictment against Yadav, saying the “U.S. government has reassured its commitment to fundamental constitutional duty to protect the life, liberty and freedom of expression of the U.S. citizen at home and abroad.”

“The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism which has become a challenge to America’s sovereignty and threat to freedom of speech and democracy,” Pannun said in a statement.

Another Sikh separatist leader was gunned down in Canada

At the same time that the plot against Pannun was allegedly in motion, another Sikh separatist leader and close associate of Pannun, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, was gunned down in Canada.

Canadian authorities have arrested four Indian nationals in connection with Nijjar’s murder. This week, Canada said that India’s top diplomat in the country and five other Indian diplomats were persons of interest in the investigation. Canada expelled all six of the Indian diplomats.

Canadian authorities also said they had found evidence that Indian diplomats have been involved in a campaign against Canadian citizens.

“We will never tolerate the involvement of a foreign government threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.

India has rejected the accusations.

Nijjar’s assassination and the alleged plot against Pannun has raised questions about India’s actions abroad, and complicated the U.S. relationship with India. The Biden administration views India as an important counterbalance to China.

After the U.S. announced last year that it had foiled the attempt on Pannun’s life, India launched its own internal inquiry to look into the matter — an effort viewed with skepticism in Washington.

This week, Indian officials involved in that inquiry were in the U.S. for meetings with their American counterparts to discuss the respective investigations. A spokesman for the State Department called the talks ""productive."""

He ordered his military to hold drills involving battlefield nuclear weapons with ally Belarus.

He announced Russia will start producing ground-based intermediate range missiles that were outlawed by a now-defunct U.S.-Soviet treaty in 1987.

And last month, he lowered the threshold for unleashing his arsenal by revising the country’s nuclear doctrine.

Putin is relying on those thousands of warheads and hundreds of missiles as an enormous doomsday machine to offset NATO’s massive edge in conventional weapons to discourage what he sees as threats to Russia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

A look at Russia’s atomic arsenal and the issues surrounding it:

Russia’s strategic weapons

The Federation of American Scientists estimated this year that Russia has an inventory totaling 5,580 deployed and non-deployed nuclear warheads, while the U.S. has 5,044. Together, that’s about 88% of the world’s nuclear weapons.

Most of these are strategic, or intercontinental-range weapons. Like the U.S., Russia has a nuclear triad of ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, long-range bombers and ICBM-armed submarines.

Since Putin came to power in 2000, the Kremlin has worked to upgrade the Soviet-built components of the triad, deploying hundreds of new land-based missiles, commissioning new nuclear submarines and modernizing nuclear-capable bombers. Russia’s effort to revamp its nuclear forces has helped prompt the U.S. to launch a costly modernization of its arsenal.

Russia has reequipped its land-based strategic missile forces with mobile Yars ICBMs and recently began deploying the heavy, silo-based Sarmat ICBMs — designated “Satan II” missiles in the West — to gradually replace about 40 Soviet-built R-36M missiles. Sarmat has had only one known successful test, and reportedly suffered a massive explosion during an abortive test last month.

The navy commissioned seven new Borei-class atomic-powered submarines, each with 16 Bulava nuclear-tipped missiles, and plans to build five more. They are intended to form the core of the triad’s naval component alongside a few Soviet-era nuclear subs still operating.

Russia still relies on Soviet-built Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. Moscow has restarted production of the supersonic Tu-160 that was halted after the 1991 Soviet collapse, aiming to build several dozen modernized aircraft with new engines and avionics.

Russia’s non-strategic nuclear weapons

The U.S. estimates that Russia has between 1,000 and 2,000 non-strategic, or tactical, nuclear weapons intended for use on the battlefield that typically are far less powerful than the strategic warheads capable of destroying entire cities.

Russia has high-precision ground-launched Iskander missiles with a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles), which can be fitted with either a conventional or a nuclear warhead.

The air force has a fleet of MiG-31 fighter jets that carry a hypersonic Kinzhal missile, which can be equipped with a nuclear or conventional warhead. Russia has widely used conventional versions of both Iskander and Kinzhal against Ukraine.

As part of the Kremlin’s nuclear messaging, Russia and ally Belarus held drills to train their troops with the battlefield nuclear weapons in May, shortly after Putin began his fifth term.

MAD and Russia’s nuclear doctrine

Moscow and Washington have relied for decades on nuclear deterrence under the concept of mutually assured destruction — MAD for short — based on the assumption that an overwhelming retaliation would discourage either side from launching an attack.

Russia’s nuclear doctrine adopted in 2020 envisaged using such ultimate weapons in response to a nuclear strike or an attack with conventional weapons that threatens “the very existence of the Russian state.” Moscow hawks criticized that document as too vague, urging Putin to toughen it.

Last month, he warned the U.S. and NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons for strikes deep inside Russia would put NATO at war with his country.

He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv.

Putin also declared the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, holding the door open to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West.

Changes in the doctrine suggest Russia “is doubling down on its strategy of relying on nuclear weapons for coercive purposes” in the war in Ukraine, said Heather Williams, director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a commentary.

The future for arms control

The 2010 New START U.S.-Russian arms reduction treaty, the last remaining arms control pact between Moscow and Washington that expires in 2026, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.

In February 2023, Putin suspended Russia’s participation in New START, but vowed that Russia would abide by its limits.

In July, Putin declared Russia will launch production of ground-based intermediate range missiles that were banned under the now-defunct U.S. Soviet INF Treaty. The 1987 pact banned missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,410 miles). He said Moscow will respond in kind to the planned deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles to Germany, taking steps to “mirror” Washington’s move.

Even as U.S.-Russian tensions soared to their highest point since the Cold War amid fighting in Ukraine, Washington has urged Moscow to resume dialogue on nuclear arms control. Putin rejected the offer, saying such negotiations are meaningless while the U.S. is openly seeking to inflict a strategic defeat to Russia in Ukraine.

Resuming nuclear testing

Russian hawks are calling for a resumption of nuclear tests to demonstrate Moscow’s readiness to use its atomic arsenal and force the West to limit aid for Kyiv.

Putin said Russia could resume testing if the U.S. does so first, a move that would end a global ban in place after the demise of the USSR.

Last month, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the nuclear test range on the Arctic archipelago of Novaya Zemlya is ready to resume tests if the U.S. does so.

Prospective new weapons

In 2018, Putin revealed an array of new weapons, claiming they would render any prospective U.S. missile defenses useless.

They include the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, capable of flying 27 times faster than the speed of sound and making sharp maneuvers to dodge an enemy’s missile shield. The first such units have already entered service.

Putin also mentioned the nuclear-armed and atomic-powered Poseidon underwater drone, designed to explode near coastlines and cause a radioactive tsunami. Earlier this year, he said Poseidon tests are nearing completion, without giving details.

Also under development is an atomic-powered cruise missile, a concept that dates to the Cold War. But the missile, called the Burevestnik, or Petrel, has raised skepticism among experts, who cite technological obstacles and radiation safety concerns. During tests in 2019, an explosion at a naval range on the White Sea reportedly involving the Burevestnik killed five engineers and two servicemen, and caused a brief spike in radiation.

Putin said this year its development was in the final stages and the military has reportedly built a base for the missiles in the Vologda region of northwestern Russia.

The Federation of American Scientists estimated this year that Russia has an inventory totaling 5,580 deployed and non-deployed nuclear warheads, while the U.S. has 5,044. Together, that’s about 88% of the world’s nuclear weapons.

Most of these are strategic, or intercontinental-range weapons. Like the U.S., Russia has a nuclear triad of ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, long-range bombers and ICBM-armed submarines.

Since Putin came to power in 2000, the Kremlin has worked to upgrade the Soviet-built components of the triad, deploying hundreds of new land-based missiles, commissioning new nuclear submarines and modernizing nuclear-capable bombers. Russia's effort to revamp its nuclear forces has helped prompt the U.S. to launch a costly modernization of its arsenal.

Russia has reequipped its land-based strategic missile forces with mobile Yars ICBMs and recently began deploying the heavy, silo-based Sarmat ICBMs — designated “Satan II” missiles in the West — to gradually replace about 40 Soviet-built R-36M missiles. Sarmat has had only one known successful test, and reportedly suffered a massive explosion during an abortive test last month.

The navy commissioned seven new Borei-class atomic-powered submarines, each with 16 Bulava nuclear-tipped missiles, and plans to build five more. They are intended to form the core of the triad’s naval component alongside a few Soviet-era nuclear subs still operating.

Russia still relies on Soviet-built Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. Moscow has restarted production of the supersonic Tu-160 that was halted after the 1991 Soviet collapse, aiming to build several dozen modernized aircraft with new engines and avionics.

Russia's non-strategic nuclear weapons

The U.S. estimates that Russia has between 1,000 and 2,000 non-strategic, or tactical, nuclear weapons intended for use on the battlefield that typically are far less powerful than the strategic warheads capable of destroying entire cities.

Russia has high-precision ground-launched Iskander missiles with a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles), which can be fitted with either a conventional or a nuclear warhead.

The air force has a fleet of MiG-31 fighter jets that carry a hypersonic Kinzhal missile, which can be equipped with a nuclear or conventional warhead. Russia has widely used conventional versions of both Iskander and Kinzhal against Ukraine.

As part of the Kremlin’s nuclear messaging, Russia and ally Belarus held drills to train their troops with the battlefield nuclear weapons in May, shortly after Putin began his fifth term.

MAD and Russia’s nuclear doctrine

Moscow and Washington have relied for decades on nuclear deterrence under the concept of mutually assured destruction — MAD for short — based on the assumption that an overwhelming retaliation would discourage either side from launching an attack.

Russia’s nuclear doctrine adopted in 2020 envisaged using such ultimate weapons in response to a nuclear strike or an attack with conventional weapons that threatens “the very existence of the Russian state.” Moscow hawks criticized that document as too vague, urging Putin to toughen it.

Last month, he warned the U.S. and NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons for strikes deep inside Russia would put NATO at war with his country.

He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv.

Putin also declared the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, holding the door open to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West.

Changes in the doctrine suggest Russia “is doubling down on its strategy of relying on nuclear weapons for coercive purposes” in the war in Ukraine, said Heather Williams, director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a commentary.

The future for arms control

The 2010 New START U.S.-Russian arms reduction treaty, the last remaining arms control pact between Moscow and Washington that expires in 2026, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.

In February 2023, Putin suspended Russia’s participation in New START, but vowed that Russia would abide by its limits.

In July, Putin declared Russia will launch production of ground-based intermediate range missiles that were banned under the now-defunct U.S. Soviet INF Treaty. The 1987 pact banned missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,410 miles). He said Moscow will respond in kind to the planned deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles to Germany, taking steps to “mirror” Washington’s move.

Even as U.S.-Russian tensions soared to their highest point since the Cold War amid fighting in Ukraine, Washington has urged Moscow to resume dialogue on nuclear arms control. Putin rejected the offer, saying such negotiations are meaningless while the U.S. is openly seeking to inflict a strategic defeat to Russia in Ukraine.

Resuming nuclear testing

Russian hawks are calling for a resumption of nuclear tests to demonstrate Moscow’s readiness to use its atomic arsenal and force the West to limit aid for Kyiv.

Putin said Russia could resume testing if the U.S. does so first, a move that would end a global ban in place after the demise of the USSR.

Last month, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the nuclear test range on the Arctic archipelago of Novaya Zemlya is ready to resume tests if the U.S. does so.

Prospective new weapons

In 2018, Putin revealed an array of new weapons, claiming they would render any prospective U.S. missile defenses useless.

They include the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, capable of flying 27 times faster than the speed of sound and making sharp maneuvers to dodge an enemy’s missile shield. The first such units have already entered service.

Putin also mentioned the nuclear-armed and atomic-powered Poseidon underwater drone, designed to explode near coastlines and cause a radioactive tsunami. Earlier this year, he said Poseidon tests are nearing completion, without giving details.

Also under development is an atomic-powered cruise missile, a concept that dates to the Cold War. But the missile, called the Burevestnik, or Petrel, has raised skepticism among experts, who cite technological obstacles and radiation safety concerns. During tests in 2019, an explosion at a naval range on the White Sea reportedly involving the Burevestnik killed five engineers and two servicemen, and caused a brief spike in radiation.

Putin said this year its development was in the final stages and the military has reportedly built a base for the missiles in the Vologda region of northwestern Russia.

JERUSALEM/CAIRO (Reuters) - Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group said on Friday it was moving to a new and escalating phase in its war against Israel while Iran said ""the spirit of resistance will be strengthened"" after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war, was killed during an operation by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long conflict.

Western leaders said his death offered an opportunity for the conflict to end, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would go on until the hostages seized by Hamas militants were returned.

""Today we have settled the score. Today evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed,"" Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement after the death was confirmed on Thursday.

""To the dear hostage families, I say: This is an important moment in the war. We will continue full force until all your loved ones, our loved ones, are home.""

Sinwar, who was named as Hamas' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades.

He was killed during a gun battle in southern Gaza on Wednesday by Israeli troops who were initially unaware that they had caught their country's number one enemy, Israeli officials said.

The military released drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building.

Hamas has not made any comment itself, but sources within the group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed by Israeli troops.

'CHIEF OBSTACLE'

Despite Western hopes of a ceasefire, Sinwar's death could dial up hostilities in the Middle East where the prospect of an even wider conflict has grown.

Israel has launched a ground campaign in Lebanon over the past month and is now planning a response to an Oct. 1 missile attack carried out by Iran, ally of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

But the demise of the man who planned the attack last year in which fighters killed 1,200 people in Israel and captured more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, could also help push forward stalled efforts to end the war in which Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.

U.S. President Joe Biden, who spoke to Netanyahu by phone to congratulate him, said Sinwar's death provided a chance for the conflict in Gaza to finally end and for Israeli hostages to be brought home.

The U.S. wants to kick-start talks on a proposal to achieve a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, calling Sinwar the ""chief obstacle"" to ending the war.

""That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can’t predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,"" he said. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said.

Iran indicated no sign the killing would shift its support. ""The spirit of resistance will be strengthened"" following the death of Sinwar, its mission to the United Nations said.

Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing ""the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel"".

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held separate phone calls on Thursday with leaders in Saudi Arabia and Qatar aimed at ending the conflict in the Middle East, the State Department said.

NO COMFORT, NO COMPROMISE

Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was a significant achievement, it would not be complete while hostages are still in Gaza.

Avi Marciano, the father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that ""the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell.""

""A little justice, but no comfort,"" he said. ""There will be comfort only when Naama, Liri, Agam, Daniela and Karina, our girls' friends, return home.""

In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, a displaced Palestinian named Thabet Amour told Reuters the Palestinian fight would continue.

""This is resistance that does not disappear when men disappear,"" he said. ""The assassination of Sinwar will not lead to the end of the resistance or to a compromise or surrender and raising the white flag.""

His death marks a key moment in the year-long war triggered by Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Militants killed some 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others.

The US and other Western countries said the death of the man considered the mastermind of the attack offered an opportunity for a ceasefire.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “this is the start of the day after Hamas” – but added the war would go on until the hostages were returned.

“Today we have settled the score,” Mr Netanyahu said.

“Today evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed.”

Israel has destroyed much of the Hamas-run Gaza Strip and killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the local health authority.

But the conflict with Hamas has engulfed the broader region to involve Iran, which supports Hamas, and Lebanon, home to the Hezbollah group.

There has been no sign from Iran of a shift in its support after Sinwar’s killing.

“The spirit of resistance will be strengthened”, its mission to the UN said.

Hezbollah, a proscribed group in the UK and US, also remained defiant, announcing “the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel”.

‘Chief obstacle’ removed

Joe Biden, who spoke to Mr Netanyahu by phone to congratulate him, said Sinwar’s death was a “good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world,” comparing it to the feeling in the US after the killing of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.

The US president said Sinwar’s death provided a chance for a “pathway” to bring Israeli hostages home and end the conflict.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller called Sinwar the “chief obstacle” to ending the war.

“That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can’t predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,” he said.

The US wants to kick-start talks on a proposal to achieve the ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, Mr Miller added.

The US state secretary, Antony Blinken, held separate phone calls on Thursday with leaders in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

He might travel to the region in coming days, according to news reports, in an effort to broker a ceasefire."

In his speech to parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, on October 16, Zelenskiy called for the ""lifting by partners of restrictions on the use of long-range weapons on the entire territory of Ukraine occupied by Russia and on Russian territory and on enemy military infrastructure"" and help in ""equipping our reserve brigades.""

WATCH: Ukrainians shared their thoughts about Zelenskiy's plan to make Russia stop its war against Ukraine.

His five-point ""victory plan,"" in which he ruled out ceding Ukrainian territory, also called for an unconditional invitation for Kyiv to join the NATO military alliance and the deployment of a strategic nonnuclear deterrent package in Ukraine.

Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy, told RFE/RL that Russia had built its ""entire propaganda campaign"" on Ukraine not joining NATO and used that point to justify attacks or provocations against Ukraine.

""The president (Zelenskiy) says let's send a clear political signal to Russia that it can no longer make an ultimatum...saying this is my region of influence and Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO,"" Podolyak told RFE/RL in Brussels.

Another point of the victory plan addresses Ukraine's competence after the war, which he said would have ""great experience"" and would be able to replace certain contingents -- primarily American -- that are in Europe now.

""Our partners are investing in security today. They should understand that there is already a specific competence of Ukraine, which will be realized later in this form,"" he said.

In his speech to parliament, the Ukrainian leader said he would present the plan on October 17 at a European Union summit in Brussel, adding that the plan had been discussed with leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany.

European Council President Charles Michel said on X that he had invited Zelenskiy to the European Council summit on October 17 ""to take stock of the latest developments of Russia’s war against Ukraine and present his victory plan.""

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told RFE/RL in Brussels on October 16 that he wanted to hear from Zelenskiy directly before commenting on the plan, but said Ukraine must receive better and stronger security guarantees because the security of Ukraine is Europe's security.

""People in Europe have to understand, I think, that we have been hesitating too much in the past in order to provide the required military capabilities to Ukraine,"" Borrell said. ""And now we don't have to hesitate.... The only way to making [Russian President Vladimir] Putin...go to a negotiation table is to have victory on the battlefield. Otherwise, it would not happen.""

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on October 16 that the victory plan was a ""strong signal"" from Zelenskiy but he said he could not say that he supported it.

""That would be a bit difficult because there are many issues that we have to understand better,"" he said.

In addition to the EU Council summit, Zelenskiy will attend a NATO defense ministers meeting on October 17, also in Brussels, according to NATO's revised agenda.

Rutte said that there was ""no doubt"" the victory plan would be discussed during that meeting. Responding to Zelenskiy's call for an unconditional invitation to join NATO, Rutte said Ukraine was closer than ever to joining the alliance and that it will happen when the time is right.

WATCH: Ukrainian children as young as 12 are burning cars and other government property to earn some quick money, an exclusive RFE/RL investigation has found.

The Kremlin immediately dismissed Zelenskiy's plan, calling it a ""diktat"" from the United States.

""The only peace plan there can be is for the Kyiv regime to realize the futility of the policy it is pursuing and understand the need to sober up,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

The Foreign Ministry said the plan meant ""trouble for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people."" Zelenskiy ""is pushing NATO members toward a direct conflict with our country,"" spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

Zelenskiy has said he expects a response to the plan before the November 5 presidential election in the United States -- Ukraine's main ally and provider of financial and military help -- where a victory by Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump could cast doubt about Washington's continued support for Kyiv.

Zelenskiy's presentation came as Russia continued to keep up the pressure on Ukraine's cities and infrastructure while Russian forces are advancing in the east toward the crucial logistics hub of Pokrovsk.

LISTEN: Ruth Deyermond, senior lecturer in the Department of War Studies at King's College London, joins host Steve Gutterman to discuss the situation on the battlefield and the latest wave of talk about talks.

On October 16, Russia attacked Ukraine with 136 drones and two guided missiles. Most of them were neutralized by Ukraine's air defenses, the air force reported on Telegram.

A total of 51 drones were shot down over the Sumy, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Ternopil, Kherson, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolayiv, Kyiv, Poltava, Chernihiv, and Chernivtsiy regions, the air force said, adding that another 60 Russian drones were neutralized as a result of electronic-warfare measures.

In the western region of Ternopil, some 50 firefighters worked to extinguish a large fire caused by a falling drone, regional Governor Vyacheslav Nehoda wrote on Telegram, saying there had been no injuries.

Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said its air defenses had downed three Ukrainian drones -- two over the Belgorod and one over the Voronezh region."

Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak.

You should start with a strong word like ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.

Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another ""good"" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path.

After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).

Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes."

What is Wordle?

If you read this far, you know how to play. You have six chances to guess a five-letter word, and the game gives you feedback as to whether the letters you've guessed are in the puzzle or not, and if they're in the same spot where you guessed they are. The New York Times bought the game from creator Josh Wardle for seven figures in 2022. Wardle famously created the game for his partner, and let her narrow down the 12,000 five-letter words in the English language to just 2,500, creating the database of answers. It was convenient, too, that he has a name that plays off ""word.""

A Times spokesperson told me it lists the very first Wordle as appearing on June 19, 2021, and the paper celebrated the game's 1,000th word on March 15. Spoiler: That 1,000th word was ERUPT. As in, ""Dad will erupt if the Wordle is so tough he loses his streak.""

Smith Memorial Dinner on Thursday evening in a roast that largely took aim at Democrats and, in particular, at his absentee opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.The Al Smith dinner, named for the nation's first Catholic presidential candidate, is considered a highlight of the campaign season. Politicians from both sides of the aisle break bread and trade good-natured jabs at the charity dinner, which is aimed at raising funds for women and children in need.Comedian Jim Gaffigan, who has ripped Trump numerous times in his routines and on social media, served as emcee.Here were some of the night's big moments:Trump UnleashedIn a stand-up style routine, Trump took aim at New York's mayors, Democrats, and, of course, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.""This guy was calling us weird,"" he said of Walz, ""but it was weird the Democratic candidate wasn't here tonight.""""She's in Michigan receiving communion from [Michigan Governor] Gretchen Whitmer,"" Trump said, in a dig at Harris' efforts to shore up support in the battleground state.Trump also took shots at her intelligence: ""Right now, we have someone in the White House who can barely talk, barely put together two coherent sentences, who seems to have the mental faculties of a child. There's a person that has nothing going. No intelligence whatsoever. But enough about Kamala Harris.""Some of his jokes elicited groans from the audience.""There's a group white dudes for Harris, but I'm not worried about it because their wives and their wives' lovers are all voting for me,"" the former president said.The moment was reminiscent of the 2016 Al Smith dinner, at which Trump similarly drew jeers from the crowd for his barbs about then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Harris Notably AbsentIn a break with a generations-long tradition for presidential candidates, Harris opted to skip the event, and instead, recorded a video that played during the dinner.She teamed up with Saturday Night Live's Molly Shannon, who reprised her recurrent role as Mary Katherine Gallager, a Catholic student.Shannon, playing Gallagher, advised Harris not to ""bear false witness against thy neighbor.""""Indeed,"" Harris quipped. ""Especially thy neighbor's election results.""Harris' absence from Thursday's event did not go unnoticed. Earlier this week, Archbishop Timothy Dolan of New York said he was disappointed that Harris wasn't planning to attend in person.""We're upset that she didn't come because we've missed an evening to accent something sorely needed now, that even she articulates rather eloquently that we've got to turn the page on, bitterness,"" Dolan said Tuesday on his podcast, Conversation with Cardinal Dolan.According to a September survey from the Pew Research Center, Catholic voters favor Trump over Harris: 52 percent of Catholic voters support the Republican nominee, while 47 percent back the Democratic nominee.Melania Makes an AppearanceFormer first lady Melania Trump, who has been notably absent from her husband's side during the 2024 election cycle, made an appearance during the dinner. She also attended the dinner in 2016.An Uncomfortable Seating ChartSitting front and center on the dais was an awkward array of political frenemies: New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully prosecuted Trump for fraud; New York Mayor Eric Adams who was charged last month with bribery and conspiracy; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer; and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, among others.But Trump took it all in stride.At one point, he turned to Adams and said, ""Mayor Adams, good luck with everything.""He later addressed Schumer: ""If Kamala loses you still have the chance to become the first woman president."""

Standing at the lectern, with Chuck Schumer next to him, Trump said that the Senate majority leader was “looking very glum. But look on the bright side Chuck. Considering how woke your party has become, if Kamala loses, you still have a chance to become the first woman president.”

Another one: “I used to think that Democrats were crazy for saying that men have periods. But then I met Tim Walz.”

Mispronouncing Harris’ first name again, Trump blasted Harris for not attending the dinner, where candidates of both major parties have, in the past, taken a break from the campaign trail for a night of levity.

Harris, who campaigned in Wisconsin today, instead sent a video greeting and skit with Molly Shannon reprising her Mary Katherine Gallagher character from Saturday Night Live.

The event is a benefit for the Alfred E. Smith Foundation, named for the first Catholic nominee on a major party presidential ticket, Al Smith in 2028. The event draws a heavy turnout of Catholic political and media figures, with Cardinal Timothy Dolan as chair of the evenings proceedings.

Trump said of Harris, “My opponent feels like she does not have to be here, which is deeply disrespectful for the event and in particular for our great Catholic community. Very disrespectful.”

When both candidates have attended, their comedy bits had tended to be heavy on self-deprecation. But in 2016, when Trump attended along with the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, he ended his remarks with a series of campaign-style attacks. Some in the audience booed him from breaking with the traditional tone of the evening.

This year, Trump quipped, “Tradition holds that I am supposed to tell a few self-deprecating jokes this evening. So here it goes. Nope. I’ve got nothing.”

The audience laughed and cheered.

Then he quipped, referring to the assassination attempts against him, “I guess I don’t see the point of taking shots at myself when other people have been shooting at me for a hell of a long time.”

Trump also made a joke about the emcee of the evening, Jim Gaffigan, who is playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live this season. “That will be a very short gig, I hope Jim. But it was fun while it lasted.”

Trump also made a joke about his campaigns focus on the border and migrants. “Mayor [Eric] Adams told me earlier that I needed to make this one very quick, especially. The city has reserved this room for a large group of illegal aliens coming in from Texas.”

Trump also quipped about Adams’ indictment, relating it to his own criminal charges. “Good luck with everything. They went after noon…Nine and a half months ago, I said, ‘He just said something bad about the administration. He’s going to be indicted any moment. And guess what happened?”

“But you are going to win. I think so,” Trump added.

Some of Trump’s jokes were met with awkward silence, as he made quips about “Barack Hussein Obama” and then went into complaints about “fake news.”

During his remarks, Gaffigan got some sharp barbs in about Trump, who was with former First Lady Melania Trump, making a rare public appearance with him. “During the first and only debate, President Trump talked about migrants taking cats and eating them. If you are keeping track at home, this is the second time grabbing a kitty has been part of a campaign issue.” That joke drew some groans. “I was going to leave that out,” Gaffigan admitted."

Vice President Kamala Harris didn’t attend the event in person, declining to leave the campaign trail in the battleground states, where polls show the presidential race is very tight. But she did appear on screen in a recorded video for a brief address to the dinner. 

The white tie dinner in New York raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities and has traditionally offered candidates from both parties the chance to trade light-hearted barbs and show that they can get along — or at least pretend to — for one night in the election’s final stretch.

It’s often the last time the two nominees share a stage before Election Day.

Trump was accompanied at the dinner by his wife, Melania, who has been an infrequent presence on the campaign trail. The two had not appeared in public together since the Republican convention in July.

Embattled New York Mayor Eric Adams also attended, along with past mayors and business leaders. Adams was charged last month with accepting illegal campaign contributions and lavish overseas trips from Turkish officials and businesspeople. 

Other notable attendees include New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a successful civil fraud case against Trump.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was greeted with applause as he arrived with his wife, actress Cheryl Hines. Kennedy dropped his independent bid for the White House over the summer and endorsed Trump. 

Comedian Jim Gaffigan emceed the sold-out dinner, which costs $5,000 per attendee. Proceeds benefit Catholic charities in New York.

In Trump’s headlining remarks, he admitted he went “overboard” in his attacks on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in his 2016 appearance, before then attacking Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff for an extramarital affair he recently admitted to when he was married to his first wife. 

“The only piece of advice I would have for her in the event that she wins would be not to let her husband Doug anywhere near the nannies. Just keep him away,” Trump said, admitting, “That’s a nasty one.”

Trump took aim at Adams for his alleged campaign finance crimes, saying he had “never met a person who’s a vegan who liked Turkey so much.”

At one point, Trump joked about the assassination attempts against him, saying, “I just don’t see the point of taking shots at myself when other people have been shooting at me.”

Harris’ campaign shared the video she recorded for the event. In it, she was joined by comedian Molly Shannon, playing the Catholic schoolgirl character she made famous on “Saturday Night Live,” who tells Harris this is one of the biggest dinners since the Last Supper.

Harris asks, “Is there anything that you think that maybe I shouldn’t bring up tonight?”

“Um, well, don’t lie,” Shannon says. “Thou shalt not bear false witness to thy neighbor.”

“Indeed, especially thy neighbor’s election results,” Harris quips.

Shannon also suggested, “Maybe don’t say anything negative about Catholics,” and Harris replies, “I would never do that, no matter where I was. That would be like criticizing Detroit in Detroit” — a dig at Trump’s comments on a visit there last week.

Gaffigan made jokes at both parties’ expense throughout the evening.

“President Trump talked about migrants taking cats and eating them. If you’re keeping track at home, this is the second time grabbing a kitty has been part of a campaign,” Gaffigan said, before later attacking Harris for not appearing in-person. 

“I’m sorry, why is Vice President Harris not here? This is a room full of Catholics and Jews in New York City, this is a layup for the Democratic nominee.”

The Harris campaign previously said that it wanted her to spend as much time as possible campaigning in battleground states that will decide the election, rather than detouring to heavily Democratic New York. Her team has told organizers that she’d be willing to attend the dinner as president if she wins.

Trump blasted Harris for declining to attend, accusing her in a social media post of being anti-Catholic. “Any Catholic that votes for Comrade Kamala Harris should have their head examined,” he wrote.

That was the kind of tone that drew boos in 2016 when Trump appeared at the dinner with his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, and unleashed a particularly nasty speech, calling her “corrupt” and accusing her of “pretending not to hate Catholics.”

Trump’s 2016 speech, delivered the night after their final debate, had begun on a less hostile tone.

Trump joked that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, used to love him when he when he was a Democrat. After noting that these kinds of dinner remarks typically begin with a self-deprecating joke, he quipped that he was “actually a modest person.”

One of his best lines of the night came at the expense of his wife as he complained that the media was biased against him.

“You want the proof? Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it — it’s fantastic. They think she’s absolutely great. My wife, Melania, gives the exact same speech and people get on her case,” he joked in a reference to her convention speech that year, parts of which had been plagiarized.

But Trump’s remarks soon veered into bitterness as he turned to the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state and he praised “the wonder of WikiLeaks” for its revelations.

“Hillary believes that it’s vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private,” he said to jeers. “For example, here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.”

Clinton also offered her share of personal digs, noting that the Statue of Liberty, for most Americans, represents a symbol of hope for immigrants.

“Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a ‘4,’” Clinton joked. “Maybe a ‘5’ if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.”

Trump’s sense of humor is often cited by his supporters as key to his appeal. While he infamously glowered through former President Obama’s jokes at his expense during the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner, he also sometimes pokes fun at himself.

At several rallies this year, he has remarked on his hair after catching a glimpse of himself on screen.

“What the hell can you do. There’s nothing I can do about it. We’re stuck with it,” he joked at a rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania last month.

Both Trump and President Biden, who is Catholic, spoke at a virtual version of the fundraiser in 2020, which was moved online due to concerns over large gatherings at the height of the pandemic. Both candidates used their speeches not to tell jokes, but to appeal to Catholic voters, with Biden speaking about how his faith had guided him through moments of tragedy and Trump emphasizing his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who plays a prominent role in the dinner, offered a message to both men about the upcoming election. “I also dare remind them that Al Smith was a happy warrior, that he was never a sore loser,” he said.

The Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner is named for the former New York governor, a Democrat who was the first Catholic to receive a major party nomination for president when he unsuccessfully ran for the White House in 1928.

The event has become a tradition for presidential candidates since Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy appeared together in 1960. In 1996, the Archdiocese of New York decided not to invite then-President Bill Clinton and his Republican challenger, Bob Dole, reportedly because Clinton vetoed a late-term abortion ban.

Supporters of Robert Roberson, who was convicted of killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, turned to the Texas high court, which normally does not get involved in criminal cases, after both the US Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state’s highest criminal court, earlier in the day rejected appeals to halt his lethal injection.

Roberson’s supporters include a coalition of Republicans and Democrats who say Roberson is innocent and was convicted on faulty scientific evidence.

Hours after the original execution time of 6 p.m. local time had passed in Texas, Roberson had remained in a prison holding cell a few feet from the death chamber at the Walls Unit in Hunstville.

Gov. Greg Abbott had authority to delay Roberson’s punishment for 30 days. Abbott has halted only one imminent execution in nearly a decade as governor and has not spoken publicly about the case.

The Texas appeals court ruling was one of a flurry of legal decisions in the hours before Roberson’s scheduled lethal injection.

At the same time a state judge in Austin was issuing a temporary restraining order, the US Supreme Court refused to halt the execution, although Justice Sonia Sotomayor — in a 10-page statement about the case — urged Abbott to grant a 30-day delay.

The state’s legal fight to get the execution carried out had faced a midnight CDT deadline when the death warrant authorizing Roberson’s execution would expire.

It was likely, however, the case would need to be resolved well before that since officials must conduct procedures such as attaching intravenous needles and allow time for an injection to take effect and a physician to pronounce him dead.

Earlier Thursday evening, a judge in Austin had paused the execution after Texas lawmakers issued a subpoena for Roberson to testify in front of them next week in a last-ditch effort to pause the execution.

“This is an extraordinary remedy the Legislature is seeking. But it is not undue.

The Legislature is allowed this constitutional authority,” state Rep. Jeff Leach, a Republican and member of the Texas House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee, said during the Zoom court hearing.

Roberson, 57, was convicted of killing of his daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the East Texas city of Palestine. Roberson has long proclaimed his innocence, backed by some notable Republican lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason and the lead detective on the case. Roberson’s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia.

“He’s an innocent man and we’re very close to killing him for something he did not do,” said Brian Wharton, the lead detective with Palestine police who investigated Curtis’ death.

Lawyers ask Texas governor and Supreme Court to intervene

Roberson’s lawyers waited to see if Abbott would grant Roberson a one-time 30-day reprieve. It’s the only action Abbott can take in the case as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Wednesday denied Roberson’s clemency petition.

The board voted unanimously, 6-0, to not recommend that Roberson’s death sentence be commuted to life in prison or that his execution be delayed.

All board members are appointed by the governor. The parole board has recommended clemency in a death row case only six times since the state resumed executions in 1982.

In his nearly 10 years as governor, Abbott has halted only one imminent execution, when he spared the life of Thomas Whitaker in 2018.

“We pray that Governor Abbott does everything in his power to prevent the tragic, irreversible mistake of executing an innocent man,” Gretchen Sween, one of Roberson’s attorneys, said in a statement.

A spokesperson for Abbott did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

Bipartisan committee takes extraordinary step to try to stop execution

The Texas committee on Wednesday held an all-day meeting on Roberson’s case. In a surprise move at the end of the hearing, the committee issued a subpoena for Roberson to testify next week.

During its meeting in Austin, the committee heard testimony about Roberson’s case and whether a 2013 law created to allow people in prison to challenge their convictions based on new scientific evidence was ignored in Roberson’s case.

Anderson County District Attorney Allyson Mitchell, whose office prosecuted Roberson, told the committee a court hearing was held in 2022 in which Roberson’s attorneys presented their new evidence to a judge, who rejected their claims.

“Based on the totality of the evidence, a murder took place here. Mr. Roberson took the life of his almost 3-year-old daughter,” Mitchell said.

Most of the members of the committee are part of a bipartisan group of more than 80 state lawmakers, including at least 30 Republicans, who had asked the parole board and Abbott to stop the execution.

Execution puts spotlight on shaken baby syndrome

Roberson’s case has renewed debate over shaken baby syndrome, known in the medical community as abusive head trauma.

His lawyers as well as the Texas lawmakers, medical experts and others including bestselling author John Grisham say his conviction was based on faulty and now outdated scientific evidence.

The diagnosis refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child’s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.

Roberson’s supporters don’t deny head and other injuries from child abuse are real.

But they say doctors misdiagnosed Curtis’ injuries as being related to shaken baby syndrome and that new evidence has shown the girl died from complications related to severe pneumonia.

Roberson’s attorneys say his daughter had fallen out of bed in Roberson’s home after being seriously ill for a week.

Roberson’s lawyers also suggested his autism, then undiagnosed at the time of his daughter’s death, was used against him as authorities became suspicious of him because of his lack of emotion over her death.

Autism affects how people communicate and interact with others."

For hours on Thursday night, Roberson had remained in a prison holding cell a few feet from America’s busiest death chamber at the Walls Unit in Hunstville.

“He praised God and thanked supporters,” said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesperson Amanda Hernandez, who spoke with Roberson after the court stayed his execution.

Although Texas’ highest court normally does not weigh in on criminal cases, how it got involved in Roberson’s case in the final hours underlined the extraordinary maneuvers used by a bipartisan coalition of state House lawmakers who have come to his defense.

Blocked by courts and Texas’ parole board in their efforts to spare Roberson’s life, legislators on Wednesday took a different route: issuing a subpoena for Roberson to testify before a House committee next week, days after he was scheduled to die by lethal injection.

Less than two hours before Roberson’s execution, a judge in Austin granted the lawmakers an order upholding the subpoena, putting the execution on pause. An appeals court then briefly reversed that decision but was overruled by the high court’s order.

“We’re deeply grateful to the Texas Supreme Court for respecting the role of the Texas legislature in such consequential matters,” Democratic Rep. Joe Moody and Republican Rep. Jeff Leach wrote in a joint statement.

In the hours leading up to the ruling, Roberson had been confined to a prison holding cell a few feet from America’s busiest death chamber at the Walls Unit in Hunstville, waiting for certainty over whether he would be taken to die by lethal injection.

“He was shocked, to say the least,” said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesperson Amanda Hernandez, who spoke with Roberson after the court stayed his execution. “He praised God and he thanked his supporters. And that’s pretty much what he had to say.”

She said Roberson would be returned to the Polunsky Unit, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) to the east, where the state’s male death row is located.

Roberson, 57, was convicted of killing of his daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the East Texas city of Palestine. His lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia.

Order capped a night of last-minute maneuvers

It is rare for the Texas Supreme Court — the state’s highest civil court — to get involved in a criminal matter.

But how the all-Republican court wound up stopping Roberson’s execution in the final hours underlined the extraordinary maneuvers used by a bipartisan coalition of state House lawmakers who have come to his defense.

Rejected by courts and Texas’ parole board in their efforts to spare Roberson’s life, legislators on Wednesday tried a different route: issuing a subpoena for Roberson to testify before a House committee next week, which would be days after he was scheduled to die. The unusual plan to buy time, some of them conceded, had never been tried before.

They argued that executing Roberson before he could offer subpoenaed testimony would violate the Legislature’s constitutional authority. Less than two hours before Roberson’s execution, a judge in Austin sided with lawmakers and paused the execution, but that was then reversed by an appeals panel. The Texas Supreme Court then weighed in with its order, ending a night of uncertainty.

Roberson is scheduled to testify before the committee Monday.

“This is an innocent man. And there’s too much shadow of a doubt in this case,” said Democratic state Rep. John Bucy. “I agree this is a unique decision today. We know this is not a done deal. He has a unique experience to tell and we need to hear that testimony in committee on Monday.”

Governor and US Supreme Court did not move to halt execution

Gov. Greg Abbott had authority to delay Roberson’s punishment for 30 days. Abbott has halted only one imminent execution in nearly a decade as governor and has not spoken publicly about the case.

Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to halt the execution, although Justice Sonia Sotomayor — in a 10-page statement about the case — urged Abbott to grant a 30-day delay.

Roberson’s lawyers had waited to see if Abbott would grant Roberson the one-time reprieve. It would have been the only action Abbott could take in the case as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Wednesday denied Roberson’s clemency petition.

The board voted unanimously, 6-0, to not recommend that Roberson’s death sentence be commuted to life in prison or that his execution be delayed. All board members are appointed by the governor. The parole board has recommended clemency in a death row case only six times since the state resumed executions in 1982.

The one time Abbott halted an imminent execution was when he spared the life of Thomas Whitaker in 2018.

Lawmakers invoke Texas’ law on scientific evidence

The House committee on Wednesday held an all-day meeting on Roberson’s case. In a surprise move at the end of the hearing, the committee issued the subpoena for Roberson to testify next week.

During its meeting in Austin, the committee heard testimony about Roberson’s case and whether a 2013 law created to allow people in prison to challenge their convictions based on new scientific evidence was ignored in Roberson’s case.

Anderson County District Attorney Allyson Mitchell, whose office prosecuted Roberson, told the committee a court hearing was held in 2022 in which Roberson’s attorneys presented their new evidence to a judge, who rejected their claims.

“Based on the totality of the evidence, a murder took place here. Mr. Roberson took the life of his almost 3-year-old daughter,” Mitchell said.

Most of the members of the House committee are part of a bipartisan group of more than 80 state lawmakers, including at least 30 Republicans, who had asked the parole board and Abbott to stop the execution.

Case puts spotlight on shaken baby syndrome

Roberson’s case has renewed debate over shaken baby syndrome, known in the medical community as abusive head trauma.

His lawyers as well as the Texas lawmakers, medical experts and others including bestselling author John Grisham say his conviction was based on faulty and now outdated scientific evidence. The diagnosis refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child’s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.

Roberson’s supporters don’t deny head and other injuries from child abuse are real. But they say doctors misdiagnosed Curtis’ injuries as being related to shaken baby syndrome and that new evidence has shown the girl died from complications related to severe pneumonia.

Roberson’s attorneys say his daughter had fallen out of bed in Roberson’s home after being seriously ill for a week.

Roberson’s lawyers also suggested his autism, then undiagnosed at the time of his daughter’s death, was used against him as authorities became suspicious of him because of his lack of emotion over her death. Autism affects how people communicate and interact with others.

To keep you informed, The Source has compiled a list of key questions on pressing topics affecting the Virgin Islands. The answers below are from St. Thomas-St. John District candidate Shenelle “Fina” Francis:

Why are you running for office?

My name is Shenelle “Fina” Francis, candidate #12 for senator of the 36th Legislature. I am running for office to provide bold, visionary leadership for the Virgin Islands. Our community deserves leaders who proactively address challenges, ensuring every Virgin Islander has access to essential services, housing, and trade school education. It’s time to build a stronger, more resilient territory where opportunity is available to all. My campaign focuses on progress, equity, and giving every Virgin Islander a voice. I am committed to bringing practical solutions to improve lives and lead us toward a brighter future.

What are your qualifications?

I bring extensive experience and a strong commitment to our community, having served in the 28th Legislature, where I gained valuable insights into the legislative process. My Bachelor’s Degree in Business Marketing from Albany State University equips me with skills in communication, strategy, and economic understanding. My background in real estate has given me a keen awareness of housing equity issues. These qualifications, combined with my deep love for the Virgin Islands, make me ready to serve with dedication and a clear vision for progress.

Why should voters choose you?

Voters should choose me because I embody the values of transparency, community-first leadership, and a commitment to addressing the pressing issues we face. I aim to continue the legacy of service exemplified by Ruby Rouse, ensuring every Virgin Islander feels heard and valued through my policies and actions. I humbly ask for your support in this upcoming election. Early voting takes place from Oct. 14 to 28, with the General Election following on Nov. 5.

How would you address the high cost of living in the territory and the lack of affordable housing?

The high cost of living and lack of affordable housing are among the most pressing issues we face, and I am committed to addressing them with innovative solutions. One of the core elements of my platform is the development of affordable tiny homes — specifically designed for families of four, with two bedrooms and a loft. These homes provide a sustainable, cost-effective alternative to traditional housing, allowing us to offer quality living spaces at a fraction of the cost.

By encouraging the construction of tiny home communities, we can reduce housing expenses while maintaining a high standard of living. I will push for policies that provide land grants, streamline the building approval process, and secure funding to make these homes available to more residents. Additionally, integrating these homes into eco-friendly communities will help lower utility costs by utilizing renewable energy solutions like solar power and water conservation systems. Together, we can create housing solutions that are not only affordable but sustainable for the future.

How would you improve the territory’s electrical grid and implementation of renewable energy?

To improve the Virgin Islands’ electrical grid and implement renewable energy, we must embrace innovative and sustainable solutions that reduce our reliance on fossil fuels while enhancing our resilience. One groundbreaking approach I propose is the development of underwater power stations that harness tidal energy. The power of the ocean’s tides can be an abundant, renewable source of electricity for the territory. Did you know that China operates the largest tidal energy station in the world, with a capacity of 3,000 kilowatts? It generates clean, pollution-free energy for all.

By exploring this technology, we can position the Virgin Islands as a leader in renewable energy and technological progress, while significantly reducing our carbon footprint. Combining this with other renewable energy sources like solar power would make our grid more robust and reliable, bringing long-term stability to our energy supply. This forward-thinking approach ensures we not only keep pace with global advancements but also protect our islands for future generations.

What would you do to expedite or improve the territory’s disaster recovery, which has dragged on for seven years now?

After seven years of slow progress, it is time for a bold, collaborative approach to accelerate disaster recovery in our territory. A public-private partnership (PPP) model, leveraging tiny homes, could be the catalyst for change.

Affordable Tiny Homes and PPP Initiatives: By collaborating with private builders, the government can promote the construction of cost-effective tiny homes as a quick and sustainable housing solution. These homes, designed for resilience and efficiency, can be deployed rapidly to accommodate those still without permanent housing.

Incentives for Builders: Incentivizing local builders with tax breaks, grants, and streamlined permitting processes will boost participation and investment, helping the economy while ensuring faster construction timelines.

Improved Lending Options: Offering favorable loan programs tailored for disaster recovery, such as low-interest and flexible repayment terms, will empower homeowners and builders alike to invest in rebuilding efforts. Collaborating with financial institutions can expand access to these funds, creating a robust ecosystem for recovery.

How can the territory improve upon its tourism product while addressing growing concerns about over-tourism? Are we too reliant on cruise tourism and what can be done to bring more overnight visitors?

In recent years, the U.S. Virgin Islands has seen significant growth in tourism, particularly from cruise ships. While this has brought economic benefits, there are concerns about over-reliance on cruise tourism and its impact on local culture and environment. To sustainably enhance our tourism product and attract more overnight visitors, it is crucial to explore innovative approaches.

One promising strategy is to emphasize our unique agricultural offerings, similar to Italy’s citrus fruit experiences. The Virgin Islands boasts a rich array of exotic fruits, from soursop to starfruit, each contributing to our local identity and culinary heritage. By establishing welcome centers and offering fruit tours, visitors can immerse themselves in our agricultural bounty, enhancing their overall experience while supporting local farmers.

Moreover, by mandating that all visitors, through partnerships with the V.I. Taxi Association, visit these welcome centers, we can introduce them to the diverse flavors and cultural aspects of our islands from their arrival. This approach not only enriches the tourist experience but also spreads economic benefits throughout our community.

Looking ahead, we remain open to new ideas that promote sustainable tourism and reduce the environmental impact of our industry. By balancing growth with preservation, we can ensure that the Virgin Islands remains a cherished destination for generations to come.

What would you propose to better support people dealing with mental illness, alcoholism, addiction, and homelessness?

To better support individuals dealing with mental illness, addiction, and homelessness in the Virgin Islands, I propose a holistic, community-based approach:

24-Hour Crisis Hotline: Establish a dedicated hotline staffed with trained professionals to provide immediate counseling and connect individuals with local mental health and addiction services. This service would act as a bridge to long-term care and create local jobs in mental health.
Support Groups for Addiction: Introduce peer-led support groups, similar to AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) and NA (Narcotics Anonymous), across neighborhoods. Collaborating with community and religious organizations ensures accessibility while fostering a supportive environment for recovery.
Tiny Home Village for the Homeless: Build a “Tiny Home Village” of 100 cottages, sponsored by local businesses, offering temporary housing, skill development, and community engagement through gardening initiatives. The village provides a pathway to self-sufficiency and stability for residents.

What plans do you have to reestablish the libraries in the territory?

Fun fact about me: I grew up in the Enid M. Baa Library, which is currently under construction, and I understand firsthand how important these spaces are to our community. The last update on the status of the Charles W. Turnbull Regional Library is that it will remain closed until repairs are completed in 2024. While we wait for the completion of these crucial facilities, it is important to think outside the box to address the literacy challenges our children are facing.

Instead of waiting for the lengthy and often unrealistic process of constructing a new facility, let’s bring books directly to the children of the territory. I propose converting a fleet of school buses into mobile libraries that can service all neighborhoods, including public housing communities. These mobile libraries would not only offer a wide range of books, but also provide library cards and allow for book borrowing and returns, just like any traditional library.

A mobile library service will:

Reach more children and families: By bringing books directly into the communities, we can reach children who may not have access to a physical library.
Combat literacy challenges: By providing easy access to books, we are equipping our children with the tools they need to improve their reading skills and expand their knowledge.
Strengthen community engagement: Offering educational resources in the heart of our neighborhoods fosters a love for reading and learning, helping to shape a brighter future for the Virgin Islands.

This practical approach can be rolled out quickly and efficiently, ensuring that we don’t lose precious time while waiting for permanent library repairs. By investing in our children’s education today, we build a stronger, more literate Virgin Islands for tomorrow.

How can we provide access to affordable healthcare for individuals and small businesses?

Create a Local Healthcare Co-op: By pooling resources from small businesses and individuals, we can negotiate better insurance rates, lowering premiums and expanding access to essential services.
Public-Private Partnerships: Collaborating with private insurers to develop affordable, tiered health plans tailored to the unique needs of small businesses and individuals will ensure coverage is within reach for all.
Subsidies and Incentives: Offering tax incentives and subsidies to small businesses that provide health insurance, along with exploring federal assistance programs, can make a tangible difference in reducing costs for both employers and residents.

Please tell us about any of your other priorities for the territory that are not addressed in the questions above.

Housing is my top priority for the Virgin Islands. The rebuild has taken far too long, and we are losing our local population due to a lack of affordable housing options. We must prioritize partnerships with developers to accelerate progress and build new developments across the territory. One key issue is the limited housing inventory, which prevents residents from benefiting from programs like the Housing Choice Voucher Program (funded by HUD) that allows recipients to purchase homes with their voucher. To address this, we need to foster public-private partnerships, streamline the development process, and incentivize builders to create affordable, sustainable housing solutions. By expanding our housing stock, we can ensure that more Virgin Islanders have access to safe, affordable homes, strengthening our community and keeping families rooted here.

Another priority of mine is ensuring additional care for our elders, who are the foundation of our community. Many of our senior care facilities currently operate on limited hours, typically from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., which leaves gaps in essential care. I propose expanding these services to provide 24-hour nursing care for all aged populations. To achieve this, we can build partnerships with the University of the Virgin Islands, allowing nursing students to earn credit hours by assisting at senior centers. This will not only improve the quality of care for our elders but also provide valuable hands-on experience for students, fostering a stronger connection between education and community service. Our elders deserve the dignity of proper care, and this initiative would be a step toward ensuring they receive it.

And finally, if you could have one superpower to move the V.I. forward, what would it be and why?

If I could have one superpower to move the Virgin Islands forward, it would be to establish a teaching hospital on both University of the Virgin Islands campuses. My experience at Emory University, where I worked under a GI physician who served as a researcher and educator at the same institution, highlighted the urgent need for proper healthcare access in our territory.

A teaching hospital would not only attract specialty doctors to serve our community but also reduce our reliance on the mainland for medical care. Unlike a medical simulation center, this facility would enable aspiring physicians to complete their fellowships here, fostering a new generation of healthcare professionals.

By positioning ourselves as a hub for medical education and specialty care, we can enhance our healthcare system, improve patient outcomes, and ultimately keep our loved ones close to home when they need care the most. Thank you!"

Many of our public schools are in dire need of repairs and upgrades to create a safe and conducive learning environment. I would propose a comprehensive school revitalization plan that modernizes our classrooms and ensures that all students have access to the technology and resources they need to thrive.

Second, we must support our teachers. Our teachers are the backbone of the public education system, but too many of them are overworked and underpaid. I would advocate for better compensation and professional development opportunities to attract and retain the best teachers in our classrooms. Ensuring that teachers have smaller class sizes and the necessary tools will allow them to provide individualized attention to students, which is critical for those who may be struggling academically.

Third, I would propose reforms to make early childhood education more accessible. Studies show that children who participate in quality early education programs are more likely to succeed academically and socially. By expanding access to preschool and early education programs, we can give all children, regardless of their economic background, a strong start.

In addition, we need to ensure that vocational and technical education programs are available and robust. Not every student will go on to a traditional four-year college, and that’s why we must invest in programs that prepare students for careers in trades, technology, and other high-demand fields. By equipping them with these skills, we give them a pathway to economic stability and independence.

Lastly, I believe we need a more holistic approach to education, one that addresses the whole child. That means ensuring students have access to mental health support, nutritional programs, and after-school activities. When children come from homes facing financial hardship, it’s crucial that schools provide them with additional resources to help meet their basic needs and focus on their education.

Education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty. By making strategic reforms to support our teachers, modernize our schools, and provide opportunities for all students — no matter their background — we can ensure that every child receives the public education they deserve and the opportunity to succeed.

What are your solutions to address violent crime in the territory, especially among young men?

Addressing violent crime in our territory, particularly among young men, is deeply personal for me. I, too, have felt the devastating impact of senseless violence. My brother was only 32 years old when he was tragically taken from us, and to this day, his murder remains unsolved. The pain of losing him still weighs heavy on my heart, and it strengthens my resolve to fight for solutions that prevent others from suffering the same loss."
54,260136924,Mankaprr Conteh,Mankaprr Conteh,Wizkid Taps Brent Faiyaz for ‘Piece of My Heart’,The duo teased the track earlier on Thursday with a video clip featuring the artists ruminating in the countryside,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/wizkid-and-brent-faiyaz.jpg,2024-10-18 04:21:36,"Afrobeats star Wizkid is back with “Piece of My Heart,” a new single featuring Brent Faiyaz. The duo teased the song in an Instagram clip earlier on Thursday with glimpses of a luxurious mansion set in the countryside.

 The track offers two distinct parts. In the first half, Faiyaz delivers the chorus: “Nothing can tear us apart/You’ve got a piece of my heart/Nothing can tear us apart.” The breezy track also sees Wizkid proclaim, “If I ever hurt you, I mean well, what I gotta do to make you know it’s all real?/If I could, I would keep you to myself.”

 The tempo slows close to the three-minute mark, as Faiyaz sings, “She don’t know, what it cost to live this life/Your price ain’t low, that’s why I write best on these flights.”

 Wizkid and US R&B singer Brent Faiyaz were seen together in Paris earlier this month at Business of Fashion’s BoF500 Gala where Wizkid performed his hits like “Ojuelegba” and “Essence.” Rolling Stone named “Essence,” featuring Tems, the best song of 2021. 

 Morayo, a name that translate to “I see joy” in his native Yoruba, will be Wizkid’s sixth studio album, called “a deeply personal tribute to his late mother” in a press release. It follows 2023’s S2 EP and his fifth studio album More Love, Less Ego from 2022. In 2020, Wizkid released one of his best known albums to date, Made in Lagos, the deluxe of which was nominated for Best Global Music Album at the 2022 Grammy awards. Ahead of the ceremony, Wizkid told Rolling Stone he achieved the well received album by following his gut. “The most important thing, and the first thing that I focused on, was just making good music. If you make good product, people are going to love it,” he said. “It was very important for me to make quality music and something that feeds my soul. That’s all I focused on.”"

It’s the lead single from Wizkid’s upcoming sixth studio album Morayo, which will be released on Nov. 22 via Starboy/Sony Music International/RCA Records. 

 The two artists were recently spotted in London together, with Wiz sharing a snippet of the song on Instagram. “Nothing can tear us apart/ You’ve got a piece of my heart/ Nothing can tear us apart (Nothing in this world)/ You’ve got a piece of my heart (That belongs to you girl),” Faiyaz sings in the chorus. 

 Wizkid has only been featured on a couple of collaborations this year, from “MMS” with Asake on his third album Lungu Boy to “Work Me Out” with Shenseea on her sophomore album, Never Gets Late Here. The only collaboration Faiyaz was a part of this year was “Should’ve Wore a Bonnet” with 21 Savage on his third album, American Dream. 

 Both artists, however, have a few common collaborators, from Don Toliver — both were featured on his 2023 album, Love Sick, with Wiz on “Slow Motion” and Faiyaz on “Bus Stop” — to Tems. Both Nigerian artists famously linked up on “Essence,” the sultry Afrobeats-meets-R&B smash that peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, thanks to a remix with Justin Bieber, and the R&B crooners came together on “Found” from her 2021 EP If Orange Was a Place, which reached No. 17 on Hot R&B Songs.

 Morayo, which is a Yoruba word for “I see joy,” will arrive two years after Wiz dropped his fifth album More Love, Less Ego in 2022, which reached No. 59 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on World Albums.
